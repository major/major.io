It was released at CES in 2015 and it received quite a lot of attention for packing a large amount of pixels into a very small laptop frame with excellent battery life. Ars Technica has a <a href=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/hands-on-dell-xps-13-packs-a-13-inch-screen-into-an-11-inch-laptop/>great overall review</a> of the device.</p><p>Linux support has been historically good on the previous generation XPS 13&rsquo;s and a <a href=http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2015/01/27/you-asked-for-it-ubuntu-officially-on-the-precision-m3800-worldwide>blog post from Dell</a> suggests that the latest revision will have good support as well. For a deep dive on the hardware inside the laptop, review <a href=https://gist.github.com/semenko/60015029e13c1de65ff6>this GitHub Gist</a>.</p><p>After wiping Windows 8.1 off the laptop, I started with the Fedora 21 installation. If you want to run Linux on one of these laptops, here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p><h2 id=the-good>The good</h2><p>All of the most basic devices work just fine. The display, storage, and peripheral connections (USB, SD card slot, mini DisplayPort) all work out of the box in Linux 3.18.5 with Fedora 21. The display looks great with GNOME 3&rsquo;s default HiDPI settings and it&rsquo;s very readable with the default font sizes without HiDPI (although this is a bit subjective).</p><p>The webcam works without any additional configuration the video quality is excellent.</p><p>The wireless card in the laptop I received is a BCM4352:</p><pre><code>02:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4352 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s possible to get this card working with the b43 kernel modules but I&rsquo;ve had better luck with the binary blob STA drivers from Broadcom. There are <a href=http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/fedora-linux-install-broadcom-wl-sta-wireless-driver-for-bcm43228/>plenty of guides</a> out there to help you install the kernel module for your Fedora kernel. I&rsquo;ve had great network performance with the binary driver.</p><p>Some users are seeing Intel wireless cards in their Dell XPS 13&rsquo;s, especially in Europe. Opening the laptop for service <a href=http://www.myfixguide.com/manual/dell-xps-13-9343-disassembly/>isn&rsquo;t terribly difficult</a> and you could replace the bluetooth/wireless card with a different one.</p><p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> If you&rsquo;re seeing errors in your journald logs about NetworkManager being unable to scan for access points, be sure to hit the wireless switch key on your keyboard (Fn-F12) to enable the card. This had me stumped for about 45 minutes. There&rsquo;s an option in the BIOS to disable the switch and let the OS control the wireless card.</p><p>The special keyboard buttons (volume up/down, brightness up/down) all work flawlessly.</p><h2 id=the-bad>The bad</h2><p>The touchpad and keyboard are on the I2C bus and this creates some problems. Many users have reported that keys on the keyboard seem to repeat themselves while you&rsquo;re typing and the touchpad has an issue where X stops receiving input from it. However, when the touchpad seems to freeze, the kernel still sees data coming from the device (verified with evtest and evemu-record).</p><p>There are some open bugs and discussion about the touchpad issues:</p><ul><li><a href=http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2u0jjd/linux_support_is_terrible_on_the_new_dell_xps_13/>Linux Support is Terrible on the New Dell XPS 13 (2015)</a> [Reddit]</li><li><a href=https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1416601>touchpad does not respond to tap-to-clicks in I2C mode in Ubuntu 15.04 on 2015 XPS 13 (9343)</a> [Launchpad Bug]</li><li><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1188439">Dell XPS 13 9343 (2015) touchpad freeze</a> [Red Hat Bug]</li></ul><p>You can connect up a mouse and keyboard to the laptop and work around those issues. However, dragging around some big peripherals with such a small laptop isn&rsquo;t a great long-term solution. Some users suggested blacklisting the i2c_hid module so that the touchpad shows up as a plain PS/2 touchpad but I&rsquo;m still seeing freezes even after making that change.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re having one of those ‚Äútouchpad on the I2C bus?‚Äù moments like I had, read Synaptics' <a href=http://www.synaptics.com/en/intertouch.php>brief page about Intertouch</a>. Using the I2C bus saves power, reduces USB port consumption, and allows for more powerful multi-touch gestures.</p><p>Oddly enough, the touchscreen is an ELAN Touchscreen and it runs over USB.

Every 3.16.x kernel I built would keep the trackpad in PS/2 mode and that&rsquo;s not helpful at all. There&rsquo;s no multi-finger taps/clicks/gestures. 3.17.0 works perfectly, however. My gut says something broke down between 3.17.0 and 3.18.0 but it might actually be closer to 3.17.4 since Fedora 21&rsquo;s initial kernel is 3.17.4 (and the touchpad doesn&rsquo;t work well with it).</p><p>A post was made on <a href=http://bartongeorge.net/2015/02/05/update-dell-xps-13-laptop-developer-edition-sputnik-gen-4/>Barton&rsquo;s Blog</a> yesterday about Dell being aware of the Linux issues. <em>(Thanks to Chris' comment below!)</em></p><p>After about 35 kernel builds during the most frustrating git bisect of my life, I found the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d1c7e29e8d276c669e8790bb8be9f505ddc48888">problematic patch</a>.

Subject: HID: i2c-hid: prevent buffer overflow in early IRQ

Before -&gt;start() is called, bufsize size is set to HID_MIN_BUFFER_SIZE,
64 bytes. While processing the IRQ, we were asking to receive up to
wMaxInputLength bytes, which can be bigger than 64 bytes.

Later, when -&gt;start is run, a proper bufsize will be calculated.

Given wMaxInputLength is said to be unreliable in other part of the
code, set to receive only what we can even if it results in truncated
reports.

Subject: [PATCH] HID: multitouch: force release of touches when i2c
 communication is not reliable

The Dell XPS 13 9343 (2015) shows that from time to time, i2c_hid misses
some reports from the touchpad. This can lead to a freeze of the cursor
in user space when the missing report contains a touch release information.

Win 8 devices should have a contact count reliable, to we can safely
release all touches that has not been seen in the current report.

It means there are something wrong when the driver is trying to read the device id of codec. I believe that is due to I2C read/write issue. ALC3263 is a dual mode (I2S and HDA) codec. And BIOS will decide which mode according to OS type. So, if you want to use i2s mode, you need to configure your BIOS to set ALC3263 to I2S mode.</p></blockquote><p>After poring through the <a href=https://github.com/major/xps-13-9343-dsdt>DSDT and other ACPI tables</a> over the weekend (and building way too many kernels with overriden DSDT&rsquo;s), it sounds like a BIOS update may be required for the sound card to function properly. The <a href=https://github.com/major/xps-13-9343-dsdt/blob/master/DSDT.dsl#L8700>sound devices</a> specified in the DSDT that are on the i2c bus are only activated after a BUNCH of checks succeed. One of them is the check of <code>OSYS</code>, the system&rsquo;s operating system. Setting <code>acpi_osi="Windows 2013"</code> does flip <code>OSYS</code> to <code>0x07DD</code>, but that&rsquo;s only part of the fix. There are other variables checked, like <code>CODS</code> (that shows up very often) that are instantiated early in the DSDT but I can&rsquo;t find them ever being set to a value anywhere in the DSDT code. These variables equal zero by default and that disables critical parts of the sound device.</p><p>My take: This laptop is going to need a BIOS update of some sort before we can get sound working properly in Linux with an i2c touchpad. If someone is more skilled with DSDT&rsquo;s than I am, I&rsquo;ll be glad to share all of my work that I&rsquo;ve tried so far. As for now, I&rsquo;m going to be waiting eagerly for some type of firmware update from Dell.</p><p><strong>2015-02-17</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s some progress on the sound card in Linux! After building the latest commits from <a href=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/>linux.git&rsquo;s master branch</a>, my XPS started showing a device called ‚Äúbroadwell-rt286‚Äù in pavucontrol. It showed up as a normal audio device but it had no output support, only input. I tried to enable the microphone but I couldn&rsquo;t record any sound.</p><p>I found a <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92061#c24">kernel bug</a> from a ThinkPad Helix 2 user with a very similar hardware setup. Their rt286 device is on the I2S bus with a Haswell SoC. Their fix was to copy over the latest firmware binaries from <a href=http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git>linux-firmware.git</a> and reboot. I did the same and an output device suddenly showed up in pavucontrol after a reboot.</p><p>When I played sounds via aplay, canberra-gtk-play, and rhythmbox, I could see the signal level fluctuating in pavucontrol on the broadwell-rt286 device. However, I couldn&rsquo;t hear the sound through the speakers. I connected headphones and I couldn&rsquo;t hear any sound there either.</p><p>There&rsquo;s now a <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93361">kernel bug ticket</a> open for the sound issue.</p><p>Stay tuned for a BIOS update with a potential keyboard repeat fix. It&rsquo;s already been talked about in IRC as a potential A01 release sssssssssssoon:</p><blockquote><p>someone asked about the fix for the repeating keypresses. yes, it was traced back to the source and will be fixed on all affected Dell platforms soon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I just saw that the one for 9343 was promoted to our factories so should be up on support.dell.com any day now as BIOS A01</p></blockquote><p>You can get notifications about driver releases for the XPS on <a href=http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-13-9343-laptop/drivers>Dell&rsquo;s site</a>.</p><p><strong>2015-03-04</strong></p><p>Sound on the I2S bus is working in Linux 4.0-rc2! <em>See note from 2015-03-08 below.</em> I was too exhausted last night for a full write-up, but here&rsquo;s the gist of what I did:</p><p>First off, build 4.0-rc2 with all of the available I2C and ALSA SoC modules. I haven&rsquo;t narrowed down which modules are critical quite yet. Once you&rsquo;ve built the kernel and rebooted into it, run <code>alsamixer</code> and choose the <code>broadwell-rt286</code> card. Hold the right arrow key until you go all the way to the right of the alsamixer display and press M to unmute the last control there. You should now be able to turn up the volume and play some test sounds.</p><p>Luckily, no update for linux-firmware is required. Also, there&rsquo;s no need for any ALSA UCM files as I had originally thought.</p><p>Stay tuned for a more in-depth write-up soon.</p><p><strong>2015-03-08</strong></p><p>After a few more reboots, I can&rsquo;t get sound working again. I&rsquo;m wondering if I had an errant <code>acpi_osi</code> setting somewhere during my testing that brought sound up on the HDA bus. :/</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://major.io/tags/dell/>dell</a></span>
