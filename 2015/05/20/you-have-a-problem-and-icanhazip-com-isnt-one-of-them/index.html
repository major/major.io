It&rsquo;s fun to run some really busy services and find ways to reduce resource consumption and the overall cost of hosting.</p><p>My brain has a knack for optimization and improving the site is quite fun for me. So much so that I&rsquo;ve decided to host all of icanhazip.com out of my own pocket starting today.</p><p><strong>However, something seriously needs to change.</strong></p><p>A complaint came in yesterday from someone who noticed that their machines were making quite a few requests to icanhazip.com. It turns out there was a problem with malware and the complaint implicated my site as part of the problem. One of my nodes was taken down as a precaution while I furiously worked to refute the claims within the complaint. Although the site stayed up on other nodes, it was an annoyance for some and I received a few tweets and emails about it.</p><p>Long story short, if you&rsquo;re sending me or my ISP a complaint about icanhazip.com, there&rsquo;s one thing you need to know: <strong>the problem is on your end, not mine</strong>. Either you have users making legitimate requests to my site or you have malware actively operating on your network.</p><p>No, it&rsquo;s not time to panic.</p><p><strong>You can actually use icanhazip.com as a tool to identify problems on your network.</strong></p><p>For example, add rules to your intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect requests to the site in environments where you don&rsquo;t expect those requests to take place. Members of your support team might use the site regularly to test things but your Active Directory server shouldn&rsquo;t start spontaneously talking to my site overnight. That&rsquo;s a red flag and you can detect it <strong>easily</strong>.</p><p>Also, don&rsquo;t report the site as malicious or hosting malware when it&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;ve been accused of distributing malware and participating in attacks but then, after further investigation, it was discovered that I was only returning an IPv4 address to a valid request. That hardly warrants the blind accusations that I often receive.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve taken some steps to ensure that there&rsquo;s a way to contact me with any questions or concerns you might have. For example:</p><ul><li>You can email abuse, postmaster, and security at icanhazip.com anytime</li><li>There&rsquo;s a HTTP header with a link to the FAQ (which has been there for years)</li><li>I monitor any tweets or blog posts that are written about the site</li></ul><p>As always, if you have questions or concerns, please reach out to me and read the <a href=../../../../icanhazip-com-faq/>FAQ</a>. Thanks to everyone for all the support!</p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/9813317@N08/5662811240/>Amir Kamran</a> via <a href=http://compfight.com>Compfight</a> <a href=https://www.flickr.com/help/general/#147>cc</a></em></p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://major.io/tags/icanhazip/>icanhazip</a></span>
