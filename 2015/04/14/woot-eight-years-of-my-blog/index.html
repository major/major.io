<content><p>The spring of 2015 marks eight years of this blog! I&rsquo;ve learned plenty of tough lessons along the way and I&rsquo;ve made some changes recently that might be handy for other people. After watching <a href=https://twitter.com/sashalaund>Sasha Laundy&rsquo;s</a> video from her awesome talk at Pycon 2015<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;m even more energized to share what I&rsquo;ve learned with other people. <em>(Seriously: Go watch that video or review the slides whether you work in IT or not. It&rsquo;s worth your time.)</em></p><p>Let&rsquo;s start from the beginning.</p><h3 id=history-lesson>History Lesson</h3><p>When I started at <a href=http://www.rackspace.com/>Rackspace</a> in late 2006, I came from a fairly senior role at a very small company. I felt like I knew a lot and then discovered I knew almost nothing compared to my new coworkers at Rackspace. Sure, some of that was <a href=../../../../2014/02/04/be-an-inspiration-not-an-impostor/>impostor syndrome kicking in</a>, but much of it was due to being in the right place at the right time. I took a <em>lot</em> of notes in various places: notebooks, <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tomboy>Tomboy notes</a>, and plain text files. It wasn&rsquo;t manageable and I knew I needed something else.</p><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/429788108_f8a6308501_o.jpg></a>Many of my customers were struggling to configure various applications on LAMP stacks and a frequent flier on my screen of tickets was WordPress. I installed it on a shared hosting account and began tossing my notes into it instead of the various other places. It was a bit easier to manage the content and it came with another handy feature: I could share links with coworkers when I knew how to fix something that they didn&rsquo;t. In the long run, this was the best thing that came out of using WordPress.</p><p>Fast forward to today and the blog has more than 640 posts, 3,500 comments, and 100,000 sessions per month. I get plenty of compliments via email along with plenty of criticism. Winston Churchill <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mfvSQbviy50C&pg=PA79">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary. It fulfils the same function as pain in the human body. It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things.</p></blockquote><p>I love all the comments and emails I get - happy or unhappy. That&rsquo;s what keeps me going.</p><h3 id=now-required-tls-with-optional-perfect-forward-secrecy>Now Required: TLS (with optional Perfect Forward Secrecy)</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve offered encrypted connections on the blog for quite some time but it&rsquo;s now a hard requirement. TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 are supported and the ciphers supporting <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy>Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)</a> are preferred over those that don&rsquo;t. For the super technical details, feel free to review a scan from <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=major.io">Qualys' SSL Labs</a>.</p><p>You might be asking: &ldquo;Why does a blog need encryption if I&rsquo;m just coming by to read posts?&rdquo; My response is <strong>&ldquo;Why not?"</strong>. The cost for SSL certificates in today&rsquo;s market is extremely inexpensive. For example, you can get three years on a <a href=https://cheapsslsecurity.com/comodo/positivessl.html>COMODO certificate at CheapSSL</a> for $5 USD per year. <em>(I&rsquo;m a promoter of CheapSSL - they&rsquo;re great.)</em></p><p>Requiring encryption doesn&rsquo;t add much overhead or load time but it may prevent someone from reading your network traffic or slipping in malicious code along with the reply from my server. Google also <a href=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html>bumps up search engine rankings</a> for sites with encryption available.</p><h3 id=moved-to-nginx>Moved to nginx</h3><p><a href=http://httpd.apache.org/>Apache</a> has served up this blog exclusively since 2007. It&rsquo;s always been my go-to web server of choice but I&rsquo;ve taken some deep dives into <a href=http://nginx.org/>nginx</a> configuration lately. I&rsquo;ve moved the blog over to a Fedora 21 virtual machine (on a Fedora 21 KVM hypervisor) running nginx with PHP running under <a href=http://php-fpm.org/>php-fpm</a>. It&rsquo;s also using nginx&rsquo;s <a href=http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_cache>fastcgi_cache</a> which has really surprised me with its performance. Once a page is cached, I&rsquo;m able to drag out about 800-900 Mbit/sec using <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html>ab</a>.</p><p>Another added benefit from the change is that I&rsquo;m now able to dump my caching-related plugins from WordPress. That means I have less to maintain and less to diagnose when something goes wrong.</p><h3 id=thanks>Thanks!</h3><p>Thanks for all of the emails, comments, and criticism over the years. I love getting those emails that say &ldquo;Hey, you helped me fix something&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wow, I understand that now&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what keeps me going. ;)</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Sasha Laundy&rsquo;s blog used to be at blog.sashalaundy.com, but it appears to
