The only problem I dealt with on reboot was that my icons on the GNOME 3 desktop were way too large. That&rsquo;s a pretty easy problem to fix.</p><p>However, something else cropped up after a while. I started listening to music in Chrome and a Pidgin notification sound came through. There was a quiet pop before the Pidgin sound and a loud pop on the end. Thunderbird&rsquo;s notifications sounded the same. The pops at the end of the sound were sometimes <strong>very</strong> loud and hurt my ears.</p><p>I started running PulseAudio in debug mode within a terminal:</p><pre><code>pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
</code></pre><p>There were some messages about buffer underruns and latency issues but they were all very minimal. I loaded up <a href=http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/>pavucontrol</a> and couldn&rsquo;t find anything unusual when multiple sounds played. I gave <a href=http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/pavumeter/>pavumeter</a> a try and found something very interesting.</p><p>When Chrome was playing audio, the meters in pavumeter were at 80-90%. That seems to make sense because I keep Chrome as one of the loudest applications on my laptop. My logic there is that I don&rsquo;t want to get blasted by a notification tone that is drastically louder than my music.</p><p>However, if I received a Pidgin or Thunderbird notification while Chrome was playing music, the pavumeter showed the volume levels dropping to 30% or less. As soon as the sound was over, the meters snapped back to 80-90% and there was a big popping sound. I lowered Chrome&rsquo;s volume so that it showed up at the 30% level in pavumeter and forced a new Pidgin notification sound - the pops were still there.</p><p>I started searching in Google and stumbled upon <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio#Configuration_files>ArchLinux&rsquo;s PulseAudio documentation</a>. (Their documentation is really awesome.) There&rsquo;s a mention of the <em>flat-volumes</em> PulseAudio configuration option. If it&rsquo;s set to <em>no</em>, you get the older ALSA functionality where volumes can be set independently per application. The default is <em>yes</em> and that default comes with a warning in the documentation:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: The default behavior can sometimes be confusing and some applications, unaware of this feature, can set their volume to 100% at startup, potentially blowing your speakers or your ears. To restore the classic (ALSA) behavior set this to no.</p></blockquote><p>As a test, I switched <em>flat-volumes</em> to <em>no</em> in <code>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</code>. I restarted PulseAudio with the new setting:</p><pre><code>pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
</code></pre><p>I started music in Chrome and sent myself an IM in Pidgin. No pops! An email came through and Thunderbird and a notification sound played. No pops there, either!</p><p>GNOME 3 was a bit unhappy at my PulseAudio tinkering and the volume control disappeared from the menu at the top right. I logged out of my GNOME session and logged back in to find the volume control working again.</p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/75638411@N05/8346700794/>Our Thrift Apt.</a> via <a href=http://compfight.com>Compfight</a> <a href=https://www.flickr.com/help/general/#147>cc</a></em></p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/fedora/>#fedora</a>
