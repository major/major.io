My criteria includes the following:</p><ul><li>Needs to stay put on my ears, even when I get sweaty</li><li>Wireless is preferable so I don&rsquo;t get tangled</li><li>For wireless, it should last three to four hours at a minimum</li><li>It needs to sound decent</li></ul><h3 id=the-bad>The Bad</h3><p>I went through a slew of headphones. Various earbuds and headphones from multiple brands would just fall off or they sounded tinny and horrible.</p><p>I moved on to the plain white headphones that come with iPhones as I had a few of those laying around the house. They wouldn&rsquo;t stay in if I started moving around, so a coworker suggested <a href=http://www.budfits.com/>Budfits</a>. It was an awesome fix for the price and the earbuds stayed in place fairly well. I&rsquo;d need to adjust them maybe once during a 30-minute run and that was manageable for me.</p><p>The cabling for those headphones bothered me if I was working in the yard or checking for cars when running across streets.</p><h3 id=the-search>The Search</h3><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jaybird_bluebuds_x.jpeg></a>Ready to give up, I turned to Twitter and asked the masses for their recommendation. Quite a few people came back and recommended the <a href=http://www.jaybirdsport.com/bluebuds-x-bluetooth-headphones/>JayBird BlueBuds X</a>. They ticked quite a few boxes for me on paper. They&rsquo;re wireless, they last around eight hours on a charge, and they boast being sweat-proof. Although it was a little more money than I was ready to spend, I ordered them anyway.</p><p>Long story short: they&rsquo;ve been amazing. The battery life is more than enough for most of my tasks and they charge using a simple micro-USB cable (same that you use for Android phones). They rarely need adjustment after you get them in your ears even if you sweat a lot. I will usually spend two to three hours working out in the yard and I only need to adjust them once or twice during that time.</p><p>The sound quality is also very good. There is plenty of bass available and the mid/high range sound is very clear. They&rsquo;re in-ear earbuds but I can still hear some sounds around me. However, I do feel the need to take some extra looks while running across streets because they do block out more sound than your average on-ear earbuds. This should be part of your running routine already, though.</p><p>The BlueBuds can be worn under-ear or over ear depending on your preference. The manual has very detailed instructions on how to size the earbuds for your ears and how to route the cabling. <strong>Pay attention to the instructions.</strong> If you don&rsquo;t follow them closely, the buds will fall out of your ears or you&rsquo;ll have poor sound quality. I was getting grumpy about the lack of bass and then I re-read the instructions. I&rsquo;m not grumpy any longer.</p><p>You can also use the BlueBuds to make phone calls or hop on video conferences with your laptop. I&rsquo;ve paired them with a 2014 Moto X, my Lenovo X1 laptop, and a Nexus 7 tablet. Pairing is a very quick process and it&rsquo;s detailed well in the manual.</p><p>They&rsquo;re also very comfortable even when you aren&rsquo;t working out and getting sweaty. I&rsquo;ve used them on several plane flights so far and they do a great job of blocking out engine noise. Keep in mind that they&rsquo;re not noise-canceling - they just muffle the ambient sounds a bit.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t received any compensation for this review.
