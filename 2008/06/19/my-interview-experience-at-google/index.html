<content><p>As some of you might know, I interviewed for a position at Google in April of this year. It wasn&rsquo;t a position that I sought out, but it all came about after I received an e-mail and phone call from a recruiter. Obviously, there&rsquo;s some things I can&rsquo;t talk about with regards to the interview process, but there&rsquo;s quite a few things that can be said.</p><p><strong>How it started</strong></p><p>The initial recruiter that I spoke with was a very friendly fellow that didn&rsquo;t seem too technical. He didn&rsquo;t get into the job description much, but he was interested mostly in whether I wanted to relocate and what type of job I enjoy most. We ran through a few cursory technical questions and he tried to find out what my skill level was in certain areas. When it was all said and done, he said I&rsquo;d be contacted from someone else at Google within a few weeks.</p><p>Two weeks later, I received some e-mails, went through [redacted] phone screens (with some pretty intelligent people), and learned more about the position. The folks from Google that I spoke with ranged from friendly and chatty to very direct and somewhat terse. Overall, I got the idea that they weren&rsquo;t interested in running a quiz, but they wanted to know how deep my knowledge and understanding was with regards to critical topics relating to the position. I know this sounds vague, but it&rsquo;s about as much as I can tell you.</p><p><strong>The middle</strong></p><p>I received a few more e-mails after the phone screens and my recruiter wanted to bring me out to California. Travel arrangements were made, I flew out to San Jose, and then drove the short drive to Mountain View. The city and the surrounding areas were a little different than I was used to. Most of the buildings and structures look as if they were built between 1960 and 1980 and they had a peculiar architecture. I stayed in the Hotel Avante (which was quite comfortable) and made the short drive to the Googleplex in the morning.</p><p>This was about the point where I slapped myself and said <strong>&ldquo;Holy crap, I&rsquo;m interviewing at GOOGLE!"</strong></p><p>When I arrived, I went into the wrong buildings twice until I found the right one, but some Google employees finally pointed me in the right direction. I met with my recruiter, who was actually pretty entertaining, and he gave me a run down of how the day would go. I spent the morning interviewing, and then I joined a Google employee for lunch. He answered many of my questions about the cost of living, job benefits, and how he liked Google. When that was over, I went back to interviewing and was escorted out of the building at the end of the day.</p><p><strong>Towards the end</strong></p><p>I spoke with my recruiter a few more times after the interview for some basic paperwork-related issues, and he worked hard to keep me in the loop on my application status. There wasn&rsquo;t much of a concern job-wise as I work for one of the <a href=http://www.rackspace.com/>best companies</a> in my industry already. However, I was getting ready to move to a new home, so I let my recruiter know that I was in a bit of a time crunch.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll probably want to know what happened next, but there&rsquo;s not really anything that I&rsquo;m allowed to say about it! What I can tell you is that I&rsquo;m still with the <a href=http://www.rackspace.com/>best company</a> in my industry, and I&rsquo;m still enjoying it each day.</p><p>So I know what you&rsquo;re probably thinkingâ€¦</p><p><strong>Why did you stay at Rackspace?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to answer this question: I learn something new every day at Rackspace. Sometimes it&rsquo;s something technical, and sometimes it&rsquo;s something related to managing people or designing technology. The people that I share this learning opportunity with make it all worthwhile. I&rsquo;ve never worked for a company where my managers cared so much about my personal and technical development. Also, I&rsquo;ve never worked at a company where, as a manager, I&rsquo;m encouraged to care for my own technicians' personal and technical development.</p><p>If you have any more questions about why I love working at Rackspace, please let me know. I&rsquo;ll be happy to fill you in.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/rackspace/>#rackspace</a></p></main><footer><hr>CC-BY-SA 4.0 &#187;
