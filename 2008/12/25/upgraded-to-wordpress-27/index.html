<content><p>I&rsquo;ve upgraded the blog successfully to <a href=http://wordpress.org/>WordPress 2.7</a> (with a bit of frustration). When I attempted the upgrade, I received this error:</p><p><code>Call to undefined method wpdb::has_cap() in schema.php on line 22</code></p><p>Even though I followed the instructions on the WordPress site, and I disabled all of my plugins, the error kept appearing. The only parts of the site that remained unchanged after the upgrade were the <code>wp-config.php</code> page and the <code>wp-content</code> directory. I merged the changes in wp-config.php, but the error was still present.</p><p>In frustration, I renamed the wp-content directory to a temporary name and uploaded the <code>wp-content</code> provided from the WordPress tarball. The upgrade completed without a problem! I deleted the new <code>wp-content</code> directory, put the old <code>wp-content</code> directory back in place, and WordPress sprang to life!</p><p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible that a WordPress plugin blocked the upgrade process even though it was disabled in the database.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/blog/>#blog</a>
