<content><p><img src=../../../../images/2019-03-17-google-pixel-phones.jpg alt=pixel_phones></p><p>We have two Google Pixel phones in our house: a Pixel 2 and a Pixel 3. Both
of them drop off our home wireless network regularly. It causes lots of
problems with various applications on the phones, especially casting video
via Chromecast.</p><p>At the time when I first noticed the drops, I was using a pair of wireless
access points (APs) from Engenius:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.engeniustech.com/engenius-products/indoor-wireless-ceiling-ap-eap600/>EAP600</a></li><li><a href=https://www.engeniustech.com/engenius-products/indoor-wireless-ceiling-ap-eap1200h/>EAP1200H</a></li></ul><p>Also, here&rsquo;s what I knew at the time:</p><ul><li>Mac and Linux computers had no Wi-Fi issues at all</li><li>The signal level from both APs was strong</li><li>Disabling one AP made no improvement</li><li>Disabling one band (2.4 or 5GHz) on the APs made no improvement</li><li>Clearing the bluetooth/Wi-Fi data on the Pixel had no effect</li><li>Assigning a static IP address on the Pixel made no improvement</li><li>Using unencrypted SSIDs made no improvement</li></ul><p>At this point, I felt strongly that the APs had nothing to do with it. I
ordered a new <a href=https://www.netgear.com/support/product/RBR50.aspx>NetGear Orbi</a> mesh router and satellite anyway. The Pixels
still dropped off the wireless network even with the new Orbi APs.</p><h2 id=reading-logs>Reading logs</h2><p>I started reading logs from every source I could find:</p><ul><li>dhcpd logs from my router</li><li>syslogs from my APs (which forwarded into the router)</li><li>output from tcpdump on my router</li></ul><p>Several things became apparent after reading the logs:</p><ul><li>The Wi-Fi drop occurred usually every 30-60 seconds</li><li>The DHCP server received requests for a new IP address after every drop</li><li>None of the network traffic from the phones was being blocked at the router</li><li>The logs from the APs showed the phone disconnecting itself from the
network; the APs were not forcing the phones off the network</li></ul><p>All of the wireless and routing systems in my house seemed to point to a
problem in the phones themselves. They were voluntarily dropping from the
network without being bumped off by APs or the router.</p><h2 id=getting-logs-from-the-phone>Getting logs from the phone</h2><p>It was time to get some logs from the phone itself. That would require
connecting the phone via USB to a computer and enabling USB debugging on the
phone.</p><p>First, I downloaded the <a href=https://developer.android.com/studio>Android SDK</a>. The full studio release isn&rsquo;t needed
&ndash; scroll down and find the <em>Command line tools only</em> section. Unzip the
download and find the <code>tools/bin/sdkmanager</code> executable. Run it like this:</p><pre><code># Fedora 29 systems may need to choose the older Java version for sdkmanager
# to run properly.
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.201.b09-2.fc29.x86_64/jre
# Install the android-28 platform tools
./sdkmanager &quot;platform-tools&quot; &quot;platforms;android-28&quot;
</code></pre><p>Now we need to enable USB debugging on the phone itself. <strong>Be sure to disable
USB debugging when you are done!</strong> Follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Go into the phone&rsquo;s settings and choose <em>About Phone</em> from the bottom of
the list.</li><li>Scroll to the bottom and tap the <em>Build number</em> section repeatedly until
a message appears saying that you are now a developer.</li><li>Go back one screen and tap <em>System</em>.</li><li>Click <em>Advanced</em> to show the additional options and tap <em>Developer Options</em>.</li><li>In the <em>Debugging</em> section, tap <em>USB Debugging</em> to enable USB debugging.</li></ol><p>Connect the phone to your computer via USB and run:</p><pre><code>sudo platform-tools/adb logcat
</code></pre><p>Your screen will fill with logs from your phone.</p><h2 id=nuggets-in-the-log>Nuggets in the log</h2><p>I watched the logs and waited for the Wi-Fi to drop. As soon as it dropped, I
saw some interesting log messages:</p><pre><code>I wpa_supplicant: wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-AVOID-FREQ ranges=5785-5825

V NativeCrypto: SSL shutdown failed: ssl=0x7b349e2d08: I/O error during system call, Success
D ConnectivityService: reportNetworkConnectivity(158, false) by 10025
</code></pre><p>The line with <code>CTRL-EVENT-AVOID-FREQ</code> isn&rsquo;t relevant because it&rsquo;s simply a
hint to the wireless drivers to avoid certain frequencies not used in the
USA. The <code>CTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED</code> shows where wpa_supplicant received the
disconnection message. The last line with <code>ConnectivityService</code> was very
interesting. Something in the phone believes there is a network connectivity
issue. That could be why the Pixel is hopping off the wireless network.</p><p>From there, I decided to examine only the <code>ConnectivityService</code> logs:</p><pre><code>sudo platform-tools/adb logcat 'ConnectivityService:* *:S'
</code></pre><p>This logcat line tells adb that I want all logs from all log levels about the
<code>ConnectivityService</code>, but all of the other logs should be silenced. I
started seeing some interesting details:</p><pre><code>D ConnectivityService: NetworkAgentInfo [WIFI () - 148] validation failed
D ConnectivityService: Switching to new default network: NetworkAgentInfo{ ni{[type: MOBILE[LTE]...
D ConnectivityService: Sending DISCONNECTED broadcast for type 1 NetworkAgentInfo [WIFI () - 148] isDefaultNetwork=true
D ConnectivityService: Sending CONNECTED broadcast for type 0 NetworkAgentInfo [MOBILE (LTE) - 100] isDefaultNetwork=true
D ConnectivityService: handleNetworkUnvalidated NetworkAgentInfo [WIFI () - 148] ...
</code></pre><p>Wait, what is this &ldquo;validation failed&rdquo; message? The Pixel was making network
connections successfully the entire time as shown by tcpdump. This is part of
Android&rsquo;s [network connecivity checks] for various networks.</p><p>The last few connections just before the disconnect were to
<code>connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code> (based on tcpdump logs) and that&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s
way of verifying that the wireless network is usable and that there are no
captive portals. I connected to it from my desktop on IPv4 and IPv6 to verify:</p><pre><code>$ curl -4 -i https://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204

</code></pre><p>Everything looked fine.</p><h2 id=heading-to-google>Heading to Google</h2><p>After a bunch of searching on Google, I kept finding posts talking about
disabling IPv6 to fix the Wi-Fi drop issues. I shrugged it off and kept
searching. Finally, I decided to disable IPv6 and see if that helped.</p><p>I stopped <code>radvd</code> on the router, disabled Wi-Fi on the phone, and then
re-enabled it. As I watched, the phone stayed on the wireless network for two
minutes. Three minutes. Ten minutes. <strong>There were no drops.</strong></p><p>At this point, this is still an unsolved mystery for me. Disabling IPv6 is a
terrible idea, but it keeps my phones online. I plan to put the phones on
their own VLAN without IPv6 so I can still keep IPv6 addresses for my other
computers, but this is not a good long term fix. If anyone has any input on
why this helps and how I can get IPv6 re-enabled, please <a href=mailto:major@mhtx.net>let me know</a>!</p><h2 id=update-2019-03-18>Update 2019-03-18</h2><p>Several readers wanted to see what was happening just before the Wi-Fi drop,
so here&rsquo;s a small snippet from tcpdump:</p><pre><code>07:26:06.736900 IP6 2607:f8b0:4000:80d::2003.443 &gt; phone.41310: Flags [F.], seq 3863, ack 511, win 114, options [nop,nop,TS val 1288800272 ecr 66501414], length 0

</code></pre><p>That IPv6 address is at a Google PoP in Dallas, TX:</p><pre><code>$ host 2607:f8b0:4000:80d::2003

</code></pre><p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to intercept the traffic via man-in-the-middle since
Google&rsquo;s certificate checks are very strict. However, checks from my own
computer work without an issue:</p><pre><code>$ curl -ki &quot;https://[2607:f8b0:4000:80d::2003]/generate_204&quot;
