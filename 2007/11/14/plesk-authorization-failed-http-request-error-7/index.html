<content><p>I found myself wrestling with a server where the Plesk interface suddenly became unavailable without any user intervention. An attempt to start the service was less than fruitful:</p><pre><code>[root@server ~]# service psa start
Key file: /opt/drweb/drweb32.key - Key file not found!
A path to a valid license key file does not specified.
Plesk authorization failed: HTTP request error [7]
Error: Plesk Software not running.

</code></pre><p><em>(Although I included the text from the drweb failure, I later found that it was not related to the issue. However, since it might appear in your logs prior to the HTTP request error, I included it anyways.)</em></p><p>This was a perfectly working server that had no other issues besides this peculiar Plesk issue. Another technician had upgraded the license a few weeks prior, and it was verified at the the time to be working properly. After a bit of Google searching, I found that the solution was to completely stop Plesk and its related services and then start it all up again.</p><pre><code>[root@server ~]# service psa stopall
