However, I can tell you that I&rsquo;ve never worked for a company before that pulled together in such large numbers to get on the phones and respond to tickets long after shifts should have been over. Obviously, it was a horrible &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; type of situation, and no one would wish for it to happen to anyone.</p><p>Over the last five years, I&rsquo;ve had dedicated servers and VPS accounts with seven companies. Out of those seven, five have had major outages. After those outages, I can honestly say I received a timely and courteous response from one of the companies in that list. In one situation with a certain Texas hosting company, I had no network connectivity for almost 72 hours with no response to phone calls or trouble tickets.</p><p>After it&rsquo;s all said and done (and it&rsquo;s not done yet), I find myself to be very proud of the company for which I work. Server parts will eventually fail, as will networks, generators and power grids - it&rsquo;s inevitable. The important part is that the will of those who are providing the support never fails.</p><p>Our will is strong, and it continues to stay that way.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/emergency/>#emergency</a></p></main><footer><script async src=https://media.ethicalads.io/media/client/ethicalads.min.js></script><div data-ea-publisher=major-io data-ea-type=text></div><hr>CC-BY-SA 4.0 &#187;
