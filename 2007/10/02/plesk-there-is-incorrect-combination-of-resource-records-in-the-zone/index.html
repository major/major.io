<content><p>Yet another weird Plesk error with terrible grammar popped up on a server that I worked with this week:</p><p><code>Error: There is incorrect combination of resource records in the zone</code></p><p>As you can see, this error is not terribly informative. Here&rsquo;s a little background on what I was doing before this alert appeared:</p><p>On Plesk 8.1.1, I needed to create an alias for a certain domain. Each time I&rsquo;d try to create the alias, I&rsquo;d receive the above error. I could even try junk domains like &lsquo;test.com&rsquo; and it would still fail with the error. I went to a different domain on the server, tried to add an alias there, and it failed as well. So, I went back to analyze the error further.</p><p>The only thing that tipped me off was the <strong>zone</strong> word, and I immediately began thinking of DNS. I checked the DNS configuration for a few of the domains, and they appeared to be pretty standard. There weren&rsquo;t any wild DNS records, and there were no problems with the named configuration nor the zone files themselves. I crawled through the dns_recs table in the psa database, and everything appears to be normal.</p><p>I admitted defeat and escalated the issue to SWSoft to get their help. The answer came back, and I was dumbfounded.</p><p>Apparently this record was present in the DNS configuration for all of the sites on the server:</p><p><code>mail.domain.com. CNAME domain.com.</code></p><p>This DNS record prevented Plesk from making an alias. <strong>Just</strong> this DNS record. In short, Plesk was unable to make the alias because of this lonely CNAME. The SWSoft developers claimed that it is an &lsquo;old-style&rsquo; notation and that it &lsquo;should not be used&rsquo;. However, during upgrades from 7.x to 8.x, they never thought it&rsquo;d be a good idea to check for this record and fix it accordingly.</p><p>Basically, the SWSoft developers recommended changing the DNS record manually for each domain to something like this:</p><p><code>mail.domain.com. A 111.222.333.444</code></p><p>I did that, and it worked flawlessly. Even though this fixes the issue, I still think that they should have considered this issue during the upgrade routines.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/plesk/>#plesk</a></p></main><footer><hr>CC-BY-SA 4.0 &#187;
