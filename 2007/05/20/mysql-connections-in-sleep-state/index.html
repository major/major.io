<content><p>On some servers, you may notice that MySQL is consuming CPU and memory resources when it&rsquo;s not processing any queries. During these times, running a <code>mysqladmin processlist</code> will show many processes in the &lsquo;sleep&rsquo; state for many minutes.</p><p>These issues occur because of code that uses a persistent connection to the database. In PHP, this is done with mysql_pconnect. This causes PHP to connect to the database, execute queries, remove the authentication for the connection, and then leave the connection open. Any per-thread buffers will be kept in memory until the thread dies (which is 28,800 seconds in MySQL by default). There&rsquo;s three ways to handle this type of issue:</p><p><strong>Fix the code</strong></p><p>This is the #1 most effective way to correct the problem. Persistent connections are <strong>rarely</strong> needed. The only time when they would be even mildly useful is if your MySQL server has a huge latency. For example, if your web server takes > 250ms to make contact with your MySQL server, this setting might save you fractions of a second. Then again, if your web server and MySQL server are so far apart to where latency is even a consideration, you have more problems than I can help you with.</p><p><strong>Restrict the connections</strong></p><p>If push comes to shove, and you have users on a server who are abusing their MySQL privileges with mysql_pconnect, then you can pull the plug on their shenanigans with GRANT. You can reduce the maximum simultaneous connections for their database user, and they&rsquo;ll find themselves wanting to make code changes pretty quickly. MySQL doesn&rsquo;t queue extra connections for users who have passed their maximum, so they get a really nice error stating that they have exceeded their max connections. To set up this grant, just do something like the following:</p><p><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.* TO 'someuser'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS = 20;</code></p><p><strong>Reduce the timeouts</strong></p><p>If changing the code isn&rsquo;t an option, and you don&rsquo;t feel mean enough to restrict your users (however, if they were causing a denial of service on my MySQL server, I&rsquo;d have no problem restricting them), you can reduce the <em>wait_timeout</em> and <em>interactive_timeout</em> variables. The wait_timeout affects non-interactive connections (like TCP/IP and Unix socket) and interactive_timeout affects interactive connections (if you don&rsquo;t know what these are, you&rsquo;re not alone). The defaults of these are fairly high (usually 480 minutes) and you can drop them to something more reasonable, like 30-60 seconds. Web visitors shouldn&rsquo;t notice the difference - it will just cause the next page load to start a new connection to the database server.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/database/>#database</a>
