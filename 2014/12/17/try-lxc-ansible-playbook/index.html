<content><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-ansible.png></a>The world of containers is constantly evolving lately. The latest turn of events involves the CoreOS developers when they announced <a href=https://coreos.com/blog/rocket/>Rocket</a> as an alternative to <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a>. However, <a href=https://linuxcontainers.org/>LXC</a> still lingers as a very simple path to begin using containers.</p><p>When I talk to people about LXC, I often hear people talk about how difficult it is to get started with LXC. After all, Docker provides an easy-to-use image downloading function that allows you to spin up multiple different operating systems in Docker containers within a few minutes. It also comes with a daemon to help you manage your images and your containers.</p><p>Managing LXC containers using the basic LXC tools isn&rsquo;t terribly easy - I&rsquo;ll give you that. However, managing LXC through <a href=https://libvirt.org/drvlxc.html>libvirt</a> makes the process much easier. I <a href=../../../../2014/04/21/launch-secure-lxc-containers-on-fedora-20-using-selinux-and-svirt/>wrote a little about this</a> earlier in the year.</p><p>I decided to turn the LXC container deployment process into an <a href=https://github.com/major/ansible-lxc>Ansible playbook</a> that you can use to automatically spawn an LXC container on any server or virtual machine. At the moment, only Fedora 20 and 21 are supported. I plan to add CentOS 7 and Debian support soon.</p><p>Clone the repository to get started:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/major/ansible-lxc.git
cd ansible-lxc
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
</code></pre><p>If you&rsquo;re running the playbook on the actual server or virtual machine where you want to run LXC, there&rsquo;s no need to alter the <code>hosts</code> file. You will need to adjust it if you&rsquo;re running your playbook from a remote machine.</p><p>As the playbook runs, it will install all of the necessary packages and begin assembling a Fedora 21 chroot. It will register the container with libvirt and do some basic configuration of the chroot so that it will work as a container. You&rsquo;ll end up with a running Fedora 21 LXC container that is using the built-in default NAT network created by libvirt. The playbook will print out the IP address of the container at the end. The default password for root is <em>fedora</em>. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend leaving that for a production use container. ;)</p><p>All of the normal <code>virsh</code> commands should work on the container. For example:</p><pre><code># Stop the container gracefully
virsh shutdown fedora21
# Start the container
virsh start fedora21
</code></pre><p>Feel free to install the virt-manager tool and manage everything via a GUI locally or via X forwarding:</p><pre><code>yum -y install virt-manager dejavu* xorg-x11-xauth
# OPTIONAL: For a better looking virt-manager interface, install these, too
yum -y install gnome-icon-theme gnome-themes-standard
</code></pre></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/ansible/>#ansible</a>
