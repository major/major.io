It may take some time for all of their products to receive the updated classification.</em></p><hr><p>Quite a few emails and IRC messages hit my screen today about <a href=../../../../icanhazip-com-faq/ title="icanhazip.com FAQ">icanhazip.com</a> being blocked by Websense products. The report on Websense&rsquo;s site claims shows that the site is part of a bot network: <em>The URL analyzed is currently compromised to serve malicious content to visitors.</em></p><p>Here are some screenshots from the report:</p><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/icanhazip-websense-01.png></a></p><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/icanhazip-websense-02.png></a></p><p>I reached out to Websense on Twitter and via their site. In the report I sent to them, I explained how the site works, gave them a link to the FAQ, and directed them to several blog posts from this site about icanhazip.com. This response from Websense hit my inbox late today:</p><blockquote><p>Hello,</p><p>The site you submitted has been reviewed and determined to pose security risk.

However, if they claim the site is serving malicious content or actively participating in attacks in any way, I&rsquo;ve found no evidence that supports that claim.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be reaching out to Websense again for additional details and to clear up the report listing on the website. If anyone knows of a way for me to identify this malware traffic and block it from accessing icanhazip.com, please let me know.
