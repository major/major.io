Traditional corporate security teams simply cannot carry this burden alone. Security teams should be looked to as subject matter experts and consultants for critical projects. The business should be as eager to engage security experts as the security experts should be to engage the rest of the business.</p><p>Lopsided security ownership quickly leads to comments like the ones in the video.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/general-advice/>#general advice</a>
