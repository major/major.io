<content><p>If your server is spewing an invalid HELO, you could be blacklisted pretty quickly. The <a href=http://www.spamhaus.org/>Spamhaus SBL-XBL</a> list and <a href=http://cbl.abuseat.org/>CBL</a> list work together to find servers announcing themselves improperly.</p><p>The common reasons why mail servers are blocked for bad HELO&rsquo;s are:</p><ul><li>Server is announcing itself as ‚Äúlocalhost‚Äù.</li><li>Server is announcing itself as an IP address.</li><li>Server is announcing itself as a hostname that does not exist.</li></ul><p>Are you unsure what your server&rsquo;s announcing itself as? Try these:</p><ul><li>Send an e-mail to <a href=mailto:helocheck@cbl.abuseat.org>helocheck@cbl.abuseat.org</a>. You will get an immediate response with exactly what your HELO contains.</li><li>Telnet to port 25 on your mailserver. Run <code>telnet mail.yourdomain.com 25</code> and wait a few seconds. Your server&rsquo;s HELO message should appear.</li></ul><p>So your server is announcing itself as the wrong thing? Well, fix it!</p><p><strong>Managing HELO with QMail</strong></p><p>If <strong>/var/qmail/control/me</strong> exists, edit it so that it matches your reverse DNS record for your server&rsquo;s primary IP address. If the file doesn&rsquo;t exist, you can create the file and add the correct hostname to it, or adjust your hostname on your operating system. Try running <code>hostname mail.yourdomain.com</code> to fix things immediately, and edit the proper configuration files to correct your hostname at boot time.</p><p><strong>Managing HELO with Postfix</strong></p><p>The default value for Postfix&rsquo;s HELO is the value of <code>$myhostname</code>. If that variable is defined in the main.cf, adjust it so that it matches the reverse DNS record of your server. If it isn&rsquo;t defined in main.cf, then adjust the hostname on your operating system. Try running <code>hostname mail.yourdomain.com</code> to fix things immediately, and edit the proper configuration files to correct your hostname at boot time. Should neither of those methods suffice on your server, simply adjust the <code>smtp_helo_name</code> variable to match the reverse DNS record of your server. For example:</p><p><strong>Managing HELO with Sendmail</strong></p><p>Adjust the hostname on your operating system. Try running <code>hostname mail.yourdomain.com</code> to fix things immediately, and edit the proper configuration files to correct your hostname at boot time.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/mail/>#mail</a></p></main><footer><hr>CC-BY-SA 4.0 &#187;
