<content><figure><img src=../../../../images/2020-12-07-dark-hills.jpg alt="Dark Hills"></figure><p>I&rsquo;ve started a <a href=../../../../tags/options/>series of posts on options trading</a> and if you haven&rsquo;t read
yesterdays post, <a href=../../../../2020/12/06/options-trading-introduction/>Options trading introduction</a>, you should start there first.</p><h2 id=recap-buying-calls-and-puts>Recap: Buying calls and puts</h2><p>Just to recap the introductory post:</p><ul><li>Buying a call gives you the <em>right</em> to buy a stock at a certain strike price</li><li>Buying a put gives you the <em>right</em> to sell a stock at a certain strike price</li></ul><p>Buying calls is a great way to capture gains from a stock that is trending
upwards an buying puts provides an insurance policy in case your stock drops.</p><p>You can make money in multiple ways:</p><ul><li>Exercising a call option to buy stock at a reduced price (without owning the
stock first)</li><li>Exercising a put option to sell your stock at a higher price (and reduce
losses on your owned stock)</li><li>The stock moves towards (and hopefully, past) your strike price and you can
sell the option to someone else for a profit</li></ul><p>But there&rsquo;s an entirely other world out there and it involves <strong>selling options</strong>.</p><h2 id=rights-versus-obligations>Rights versus Obligations</h2><p>So far, we&rsquo;ve only talked about rights. When you buy an options contract, you
have the right to do nothing, exercise the option, or sell it away to someone
else.</p><p>Selling options means you <strong>must fulfill an obligation.</strong> We aren&rsquo;t talking
about selling an option you purchased &ndash; that&rsquo;s simply called <em>selling to
close</em>. What we&rsquo;re talking about here is a different concept: <em>selling to
open</em>. This is sometimes called <em>writing a put</em> or <em>writing a call</em>.</p><p>When you sell a contract, you are paid a sum of money called a <em>premium</em>. The
buyer is the one paying the premium to you. Let&rsquo;s dig into what&rsquo;s happening
here:</p><ul><li>You are going out into the market and saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get $200 to sell
this put that expires on December 31&rdquo;</li><li>A buyer can choose to take you up on your offer, give you $200, and the
contract is written</li><li><strong>The contract is written in stone until the expiration date</strong></li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s key to remember here that there are only two ways out of an options
contract that you sell:</p><ol><li>You buy it back (hopefully at a profit). This is called <em>buying to close</em>.</li><li>The option expires.</li></ol><p>There are three warnings we must cover before we go any further:</p><p>ðŸ’£ <strong>Never sell an options contract that you do not intend to fulfill.</strong> Sure,
it may sound amazing to receive $4,000 in an instant to sell an option, but
eventually that option expires and that can sometimes be a disaster.</p><p>ðŸ’£ <strong>Never assume that you will be able to buy to close your sold contract
before expiration.</strong> The market does weird things and you may be stuck with
holding your option through expiration or taking a loss before expiration.</p><p>ðŸ’£ <strong>Never sell options contracts if you don&rsquo;t have stock or cash to cover
them.</strong> Getting stuck in a margin call (or worse) with your broker is not a
good place to be.</p><p>With that said, about 95% of my current trades involve selling options. More
on that later.</p><h2 id=selling-puts>Selling puts</h2><p>We should talk about selling puts first because that concept is a little
easier. When you sell a put, you specify a few things:</p><ul><li>Underlying stock ticket (such as AMD, WMT, or TM)</li><li>Expiration date</li><li>How much premium you want (this is the <em>ask</em> portion of the bid/ask spread)</li><li>The strike price</li></ul><p>Selling puts can make money in a few different ways. The stock can go up, go
sideways (where it hovers around a certain price), or go down a little.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go through an example. You think AMD is likely going to keep its same
price or go up over the next few weeks. If AMD is trading at $100 now, you
decide to sell a put for $90 and collect $200 in premium.</p><p>ðŸ›‘ <strong>Before entering this trade, ensure you have <em>at least</em> $9,000 of cash in
your account.</strong> 100 shares of AMD could potentially cost you $9,000 if you are
assigned &ndash; more on that below.</p><p>Now what?</p><ul><li>AMD skyrockets up to $125<ul><li>Your put loses value rapidly and you can buy it back for only $25 after a
few days. You just made $175 in profit since you originally received $200
for selling the contract and paid $25 to close it.</li><li>You can let your put expire and keep the $200 premium. (Risky!)</li></ul></li><li>AMD gets stuck at $100<ul><li>Over time, your put loses value and you can buy it back at a
cheaper rate before it expires (optional).</li><li>You can let your put expire and keep the $200 premium. (Risky!)</li></ul></li><li>AMD falls to $85<ul><li>You&rsquo;re now in the money and that&rsquo;s not great for a sold option.</li><li>The buyer will likely exercise the option they bought from you and you
will be <em>assigned</em> at a loss. (Keep reading)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=assignment-on-puts>Assignment on puts</h2><p>Some traders hear about <em>assignment</em> and they run off to hide. Assignment
means that the buyer of your contract wants to use their right to exercise.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the very last example above where we sold a put for $90 and
AMD fell to $85. This situation feels scary until you break it down:</p><ul><li>You keep your $200 no matter what. You sold the contract and that&rsquo;s yours.</li><li>You must buy 100 shares of AMD at $90 each.</li></ul><p>But wait, you have to buy AMD at $90 even though AMD fell to $85! That&rsquo;s your
obligation for selling the contract. That means you will lose $500 on the
stock purchase. (You bought $8,500 of AMD stock but had to pay $9,000 for it.)</p><p>All together, you lost $300. You paid $500 extra for the AMD shares but you
kept your $200 premium for selling the contract. But, now you have 100 AMD
shares worth $8,500 in your account!</p><p>What do you do with those?</p><h2 id=selling-calls>Selling calls</h2><p>Now you have 100 shares of AMD in your account worth $8,500 and you&rsquo;re still
down $300. It&rsquo;s time to talk about selling calls. Selling calls and puts
involve the same concepts of specifying a strike price, how much premium you
want, and an expiration date.</p><p>You take a look at the options chain and you see that you can sell an AMD call
for the $90 strike price for $250 and it expires in a few weeks. This is
called a <em>covered call</em> since you own 100 shares as collateral for the
contract.</p><p>You sell the call and now there are some potential outcomes:</p><ul><li>AMD falls to $80<ul><li>Your call loses value rapidly and you can buy it back for a tiny amount.
If you buy your call back at $25, then you made $225. ($250 premium
originally received minus $25 you paid to close it)</li><li>Go back and sell another call, collect more premium, and increase your
profit.</li><li>Allow the call to expire worthless and keep your full $250 premium. (Risky!)</li></ul></li><li>AMD gets stuck at $85<ul><li>Your call gradually loses value and you can buy it back for a tiny amount.</li><li>Go back and sell another call, collect more premium, and increase your
profit.</li></ul></li><li>AMD climbs to $95<ul><li>You&rsquo;re now in the money here.</li><li>When the option expires, the buyer of your contract will likely want to
exercise and they will buy your shares at $90 each (your strike price).</li><li>Your shares are gone. (But keep reading.)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=assignment-on-calls>Assignment on calls</h2><p>Getting assigned on puts means you have to buy the stock at your stike price.
Getting assigned on calls is a little different. You <em>sell</em> your stock at the
strike price to the person who bought your call option contract.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the previous example where you sold a $90 call option for
$250 and AMD went to $95 per share:</p><ul><li>You keep your $250 premium since you sold the contract.</li><li>You sell your 100 AMD shares at $90 each (your strike price) even though AMD
is trading at $95.</li></ul><p>Technically, you lost out on $500 of profit that you could have received if
you had not sold the call. However, you keep the $250 of premium and you can
begin selling puts again.</p><h2 id=why-not-just-buy-stock-and-hold-it>Why not just buy stock and hold it?</h2><p>I have accounts where I buy stock and hold it for a long time. However,
selling options allows you to collect premium and get profits even in a market
that isn&rsquo;t moving much.</p><p>If a stock gets stuck in a sideways pattern where it doesn&rsquo;t move much for
weeks, buying and holding the stock might give you a very small gain. During
that time, you may have been able to get a better return selling options on
that stock and collecting the premium.</p><h2 id=whats-the-worst-that-can-happen>What&rsquo;s the worst that can happen?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s always important to know what your max loss is for any trade. Losses
begin when the stock price breaches your breakeven price:</p><ul><li>Put breakeven = strike price - premium received</li><li>Call breakeven = strike price + premium received</li></ul><p>If you sell a $90 put for $200 and the stock falls to $89, you are still up
$100. If you sell a $90 call for $200 and the stock goes up to $91.50, you are
still up $50.</p><p>However, if you are selling puts or calls, there is a chance that the stock
could completely crater and go to zero. The chances of that happening to a
well-known company that has been on the market for years is <strong>very low</strong>, but
it&rsquo;s important to know max loss.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you sold a put on company XYZ at the $100 strike and received $500
in premium. The stock somehow falls to $1 per share. Your max loss here is
<code>((100 x $100) - (100 * x $1)) - $500 = $9,400</code>. The buyer of your options
contract will <strong>surely</strong> want to exercise so they can sell their XYZ stock at
$100 instead of $1.</p><p>On the call side, let&rsquo;s say you sold a $110 call on XYZ for $500 and the stock
fell to $1. The 100 shares of XYZ you own would now be worth $1 per share, but
you do keep your $500 premium. If you had owned the shares without selling
that call at that time, you would have suffered the same fate (without getting
$500 in premium).</p><h2 id=the-wheel>The Wheel</h2><p>The strategy shown here is called the wheel strategy. It involves these steps:</p><ol><li>Sell puts and collect premium</li><li>If unassigned, go back to step 1</li><li>If assigned, sell calls and collect premium</li><li>If unassigned, go back to step 3</li><li>If assigned, go back to step 1</li></ol><p>This strategy will be covered in the next post!</p><p><em>Disclaimer: Keep in mind that I am not an investment professional and you
