<content><p><img src=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/openstack-justheo.png alt=1></p><p>My work at Rackspace has changed a bit in the last few weeks and I&rsquo;ve shifted from managing a team of engineers to a full technical focus on <a href=http://openstack.org/projects/compute/>OpenStack Nova</a>. Although it was difficult to leave my management position, I&rsquo;m happy to get back to my roots and dig into the technical stuff again.</p><p>One of the first things I wanted to tackle was understanding how a build request flows through Nova to a XenServer hypervisor. Following this process through the code is a bit tricky (I&rsquo;m still learning python, so that could explain it). Here are the basic steps:</p><ul><li>Client requests a build via the API.</li><li>The API runs some checks (quotas, auth, etc) and hands the build off to the scheduler.</li><li>The scheduler figures out where the instance should go.</li><li>The scheduler drops a message in queue specific to one compute node (where the instance will be built).</li><li>The API responds to the client and the client is now unblocked and free to do other things.</li><li>The compute node updates the database with the instance details and calls to the hypervisor to assemble block devices for the instance.</li><li>A message is dropped into the network node&rsquo;s queue (from the compute node) to begin assembling networks for the instance. The compute node blocks and waits while this step completes.</li><li>Once the networking details come back (via the queue), the compute node does the remaining adjustments on the hypervisor and starts up the actual instance.</li><li>When the instance starts successfully (or fails to do so), the database is updated and a message is dropped onto another message queue as a notification that the build is complete.</li></ul><p><img src=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tracing-an-Instance-Build-Through-Nova.png alt=3></p><p>Click on the thumbnail on the right to see the flow chart I created to explain this process.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> This information should be accurate to the Nova code as of November 1, 2011. There could be some refactoring of these build processes before <a href=https://launchpad.net/nova/essex>Essex</a> is released.</p><p></p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/cloud/>#cloud</a>
