<content><p>I was surprised to see coverage about <a href=http://rackerhacker.com/icanhazip-com-faq/>icanhazip.com</a> on <a href=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/03/find-your-public-ip-anywhere-with-icanhazip-com/>Lifehacker</a> last Sunday and I was curious to know what effect the story would have on my site&rsquo;s overall traffic. <a href=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/dave-drager/>Dave Drager</a> wrote a great summary of what the site offers and how people can use it in their daily work. It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that icanhazip.com really only serves a niche group of internet users, but even I was surprised at the level of interest.</p><p><img src=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/icanhazip_lifehacker_traffic.jpg alt=lifehacker_graph> icanhazip.com traffic data - March 2011</p><p>The graph on the right shows some recent traffic data from March 2011. The Lifehacker story was published around 7AM on March 27th in Australia, so I first started seeing a spike on the 26th (my server&rsquo;s time zone is UTC-5). The yellow bar is a count of the unique visits while the other bars count page views, hits and total bandwidth.</p><p>The count of unique visitors certainly increased (by about 10-11x), but the overall hits didn&rsquo;t increase by much. I&rsquo;d imagine that most visitors accessed the site, noticed that it displayed their public IP, and then they went on their way. As I&rsquo;ve said before, this site is easy to re-create and will really only serve a niche segment of internet users.</p><p>On most days, I&rsquo;ll receive a very high number of hits from a relatively small number of unique IP addresses. There are quite a few people who check their public-facing IP address every second, but it seems like the majority stick to a more reasonable interval of 5-30 minutes. I&rsquo;ve yet to find the value in checking my public IP address once per second, but there are obviously some folks out there who find it valuable (or they aren&rsquo;t good at implementing sleeps in their scripts).</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of trivia about the site for those who are interested:</p><ul><li>Almost 40% of the traffic to the site is from Eastern European and Asian countries</li><li>The average user on the site generates about 45 hits per day</li><li>Linux users make up 91% of the traffic on the site (based on user agent strings)</li><li>Over 88% of the hits to the site are requests made with curl or wget</li><li>Most traffic is received between 4-5PM CDT</li><li>Almost 98% of the visitors who reach the site do so via a direct link without a referrer</li></ul></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/command-line/>#command line</a>
