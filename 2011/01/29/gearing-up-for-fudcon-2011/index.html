This morning kicks off with the BarCamp pitches themselves and they are supposed to last only 20 seconds each. I&rsquo;m new to this format of conferences but I&rsquo;m eager to see how it works.</p><p>Quite a few people on Twitter have asked me if I could toss some summaries of some of the talks onto the blog. I will certainly try my best to do so!</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a sampling of the photos I&rsquo;ve taken so far:</p><ul><li><a href=http://rkrh.kr/1296241117.jpg>iPad being used as a laptop</a></li><li><a href=http://rkrh.kr/1296265179.jpg>List of sponsors (hey, it&rsquo;s Rackspace!)</a></li><li><a href=http://thesocialnerd.com/best-job-title-ever-written>Ian Weller has a great job title</a></li><li><a href=http://thesocialnerd.com/everybody-needs-a-little-loaf-love>Strange &ldquo;Loaf Love&rdquo; truck in the hotel parking lot</a></li><li><a href=http://thesocialnerd.com/qr-barcodes-at-fudcon-are-a-great-idea>My conference badge along with a handy QR barcode</a></li><li><a href=http://thesocialnerd.com/sunrise-over-tempe-arizona>Sunrise over Tempe</a></li></ul></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/fedora/>#fedora</a>
