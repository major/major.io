<content><p>Keeping an eye out for the <a href=http://devopsweekly.com/>DevOps Weekly email</a> is something I&rsquo;ve enjoyed since it started at the end of 2010. It&rsquo;s usually chock full of tips for systems engineers, developers, managers, or anyone who is focused on environments that utilize continuous integration and deployment strategies. Quite a few of the tips are totally relevant for information security professionals who are looking for an edge at work.</p><p>This week, there are four links worth reviewing if you work in information security:</p><ul><li><a href=http://www.sitespeed.io/>sitespeed.io</a></li><li><a href=http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2013/11/burnout-recovery-and-honesty/>Burnout, Recovery and Honesty</a></li><li><a href=http://flowcon.org/dl/flowcon-sanfran-2013/slides/JamesDeLuccia_SuccessfullyEstablishingAndRepresentingDevOpsInAnAudit.pdf>Audits of High Deployment Environments</a> [PDF]</li><li><a href=http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/>A tcpdump Primer</a></li></ul><p>The idea behind <a href=http://www.sitespeed.io/>sitespeed.io</a> is to monitor an application&rsquo;s performance through deployments. Availability is critical to security (although it&rsquo;s often de-prioritized until you feel the pain) and it can signal an attack in process. Performance degradation over time could allow the application to be knocked offline from smaller attacks.</p><p><a href=http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2013/11/burnout-recovery-and-honesty/>Burnout, Recovery and Honesty</a> is an anecdote from an IT worker about how their job changed their personal and home life. It&rsquo;s worth a read so that you can catch the warning signs of burnout within yourself and your coworkers.</p><p>Bringing continuous deployments to large companies is challenging due to the number of compliance and regulatory programs. A great slide deck called <a href=http://flowcon.org/dl/flowcon-sanfran-2013/slides/JamesDeLuccia_SuccessfullyEstablishingAndRepresentingDevOpsInAnAudit.pdf>Audits of High Deployment Environments</a> covers some of the basic strategies for how to deal with these challenges.</p><p>Finally, my favorite nugget from this week&rsquo;s newsletter is the the <a href=http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/>tcpdump primer</a>. It&rsquo;s a great resource for people who have never used tcpdump or for those of us who have only used some of the basic functionality. You&rsquo;ll be able to get more data out of tcpdump with less fuss after reading the post.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/devops/>#devops</a>
