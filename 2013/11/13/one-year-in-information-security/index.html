A former manager taught me this method and it works extremely well.</p><p>I prefer to talk about things you should do rather than the things you shouldn&rsquo;t, but there are two critical things I have to mention.Â  Don&rsquo;t spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).Â  Also, certifications don&rsquo;t make you an expert.Â  When people feel that you&rsquo;re constantly throwing out doomsday scenarios or you&rsquo;re grandstanding with alphabet soup after your name, they&rsquo;ll become desensitized to your message.Â  The difficulty involved with changing their minds is then ratcheted up another level.</p><p><strong>Evade analysis paralysis by painting with broad strokes</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to sweat the small stuff in information security.Â  If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just look at your average vulnerability scan report.Â  Once you filter out all of the false positives and irrelevant vulnerabilities, you&rsquo;re left with a final few items that are worth an additional review.Â  Scan reports of multiple systems (or subnets) can get out of hand quickly.Â  Sure, those vulnerabilities should be fixed, but think about how you can take a bigger picture approach to the problem.</p><p>Another favorite book of mine is <a href=http://itrevolution.com/books/phoenix-project-devops-book/><em>The Phoenix Project</em></a>.Â  It&rsquo;s an adaptation of <em>The Goal</em> that is specific to IT workers.Â  The main character is suddenly promoted after his superiors are relieved and he is overwhelmed with tons of IT problems big and small.Â  After a good dose of firefighting and tactical work, he discovers that the problems plaguing his department are very broad.Â  Change management, documentation, and resource contention were completely out of control.Â  He comes to terms with the problems and realizes that he won&rsquo;t succeed unless he steps back and looks at the big picture.Â  There&rsquo;s also an amazing CISO character in the book and he goes through the same transformation.</p><p>Instead of focusing on the small battles, focus on the war.Â  Look for ways to drive consistency first.Â  If nobody has set the bar for security within your organization, set it.Â  Start out with something simple and partner with your supporters in the business to gain buy-in.Â  Setting a standard does something interesting to humans: we don&rsquo;t want anything we maintain to be called &ldquo;substandard.&rdquo;</p><p>Find ways to weave your standards in with the business in helpful ways.Â  Write scripts.Â  Do demos.Â  Figure out which configuration management software they use and try to build your standards into the existing frameworks.Â  Talk to them on their turf and in their terms.Â  When they hear you speaking their language and integrating with their tools, they will be much more eager to collaborate with you.Â  That&rsquo;s a great time to deliver your message and weave security into the fabric of their project.</p><p>Building consistency will take time depending on the maturity of the organization.Â  As it builds, raise the bar with the help of your supporters.Â  Do it gradually and closely monitor the effects.Â  Businesses constantly do this with software development cycles and uptime improvements.Â  Implementing security is no different.</p><p><strong>Drive self-reliance by making them part of the process</strong></p><p>One of my peers said it best: &ldquo;Everyone is part of the security team.Â  We all play a part.&rdquo;Â  Getting people to feel that they&rsquo;re responsible for security isn&rsquo;t easy, but you can make an impact by explaining the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind your changes, partnering with standards, and keeping an open door policy.</p><p>Security teams need to maintain a feedback loop with the business.Â  I feel like I say this constantly: &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have a security team if we never launch a product.&rdquo;Â  There&rsquo;s always going to be a situation where something launches with vulnerabilities (whether known or unknown) and the business accepts the risk.Â  Don&rsquo;t dwell on that; you&rsquo;re sweating the small stuff.Â  Instead, think about helping the business avoid that risk in the future.Â  Should we develop a standard?Â  Is our testing process rigorous enough?Â  Do we need more detailed training for developers or engineers?</p><p>That feedback loop must include open and frank discussions about failures without a rush to blame.Â  My favorite example of this thought process is a post from <a href=https://twitter.com/allspaw>John Allspaw</a> titled <a href=http://www.kitchensoap.com/2013/09/30/learning-from-failure-at-etsy/><em>Learning from Failure at Etsy</em></a>.Â  A business can drive accountability without needing to place blame.Â  If you&rsquo;ve ever gone through a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram>fishbone diagram</a> or you&rsquo;ve answered the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys>Five Why&rsquo;s</a>, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.Â  Trace it back to the original failure and you&rsquo;ll most often find a process or a technology problem and not a people problem.</p><p>If an IT team can&rsquo;t be honest with a security team because they fear punishment or shaming, then they won&rsquo;t share the real problems.Â  This could be disastrous for a security team since they&rsquo;re operating with only a portion of the real story.Â  The opposite is also true: security teams must feel comfortable sharing their failures.Â  Healthy feedback loops like these build trust and engagement.Â  That leads to more process improvements and fewer failures.Â  If there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;ve learned about security teams, it&rsquo;s that we don&rsquo;t want to fail.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This post might read a bit more pedantic than I intended, but I hope you find it useful.Â  Much of it applies to more than just information security.Â  Think about where you work in your company and which groups you find yourself at odds with daily.Â  Learn what motivates your supporters, paint with broad strokes, and make everyone part of the process.</p><p>You might find more in common with them than you ever expected.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://major.io/tags/general-advice/>general advice</a></span>
