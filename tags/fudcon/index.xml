As promised, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize the day and cover the talks which I attended.
The day started out with Jared Smith&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;State of Fedora&amp;rdquo; address. The audio has already been posted on the wiki, but the speech was very positive overall. He talked about some of the struggles that have happened in the past and how they&amp;rsquo;ll probably happen again in some form or another.</description></item><item><title>Gearing up for FUDCon 2011</title><link>https://major.io/2011/01/29/gearing-up-for-fudcon-2011/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2011 15:01:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/01/29/gearing-up-for-fudcon-2011/</guid><description>FUDCon 2011 in Tempe hasn&amp;rsquo;t even fully started yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s been well worth the trip already. We put quite a few names with faces (or IRC nicks with faces) and discussed our initial forays into Linux when we were young.
From what I was told last night, this is the first conference organized by folks not already working for Red Hat (even though some of them were hired on after planning was underway) and presentations are done in BarCamp format.</description></item></channel></rss>
