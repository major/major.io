This was my first trip to any DevConf and it was my second trip to Brno.
Lots of snow showed up on the second day and more snow arrived later in the week!
First talk of 2019 I co-presented a talk with one of my teammates, Nikolai, about some of the fun work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing at Red Hat to improve the quality of the Linux kernel in an automated way.</description></item></channel></rss>
