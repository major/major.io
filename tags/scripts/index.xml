It was quite popular and its performance degraded over time as more users signed up and began posting updates. Eventually, Twitter killed the jabber bot altogether. Many users have asked when it will return.

First, get your iptables rules set up the way you like them. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve verified that everything works, save the rules:
Next, open up /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables in your favorite text editor and add the following:
