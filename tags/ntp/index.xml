ntpd_initres[2619]: ntpd returns a permission denied error!
It would only appear about every five minutes on the server, and restarting ntpd didn&amp;rsquo;t correct the issue. I stopped ntpd entirely, but the error still appeared a few minutes later.
After examining the running processes, I found that there was a lonely ntpd process that was running using a non-standard method.</description></item></channel></rss>
