It always seemed like SELinux would get in my way and keep me from getting work done.
Later on, I found that one of my servers (which I&amp;rsquo;d previously secured quite thoroughly) had some rogue processes running that were spawned through httpd. Had I actually been using SELinux in enforcing mode, those processes would have probably never even started.</description></item></channel></rss>
