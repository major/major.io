Most folks suggested Feedly as a replacement but I found the UI quite clunky in a browser and on Android devices.
Then someone suggested Tiny Tiny RSS. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t learn more about it on the day Google Reader&amp;rsquo;s shutdown was announced because the site was slammed. In a nutshell, Tiny Tiny RSS is a well-written web UI for managing feeds and a handy API for using it with mobile applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
