If you compare your results and you see different IP addresses, there&amp;rsquo;s most likely a proxy in the way.
To make things easier, I&amp;rsquo;ve launched icanhazproxy.com. It&amp;rsquo;s available on ports 80, 81 and 443 as well. If you choose to access it on port 443, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a certificate for icanhazip.com that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ignore.</description></item><item><title>Simple SOCKS proxy using SSH</title><link>https://major.io/2009/05/26/simple-socks-proxy-using-ssh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2009 19:29:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2009/05/26/simple-socks-proxy-using-ssh/</guid><description>Sometimes we find ourselves in places where we don&amp;rsquo;t trust the network that we&amp;rsquo;re using. I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in quite a few situations where I know my data is being encrypted, but I want an additional layer of protection. Luckily, that protection is built into SSH if you&amp;rsquo;d like to use it.
Create a simple SOCKS proxy with SSH by using the -D flag:
That command will open up a SOCKS proxy on your workstation on port 2400.</description></item></channel></rss>
