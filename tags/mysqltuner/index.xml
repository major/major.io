It&amp;rsquo;s approaching the 1.0 release and I feel like celebrating. I thought about putting together some T-shirts (because as a nerd, I enjoy the occasional techy T-shirt), but I can&amp;rsquo;t come up with a good slogan.
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of some pretty hilarious slogans for database-related activities, like &amp;ldquo;DBA&amp;rsquo;s know how to take dumps&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t overflow my buffer&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to come up with some good ones for MySQLTuner.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner is now a Fedora 9 package!</title><link>https://major.io/2008/06/27/mysqltuner-is-now-a-fedora-9-package/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2008 17:16:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/06/27/mysqltuner-is-now-a-fedora-9-package/</guid><description>Thanks to some work started by Ville SkyttÃ¤, MySQLTuner is now included in Fedora 9 repositories:

This long-awaited update includes bug fixes, feature enhancements, and compatibility improvements.
MySQLTuner now checks for fragmented tables
When deletes or updates are made on tables, MySQL will often leave holes behind that it hopes to fill in later. If the size and quantity keep climbing, the holes can cause performance degradation for writes and reads. Fragmentation can be corrected with OPTIMIZE TABLE, and the script recommends it if needed.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner v0.9.0 is now available</title><link>https://major.io/2008/04/06/mysqltuner-v090-is-now-available/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2008 14:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/04/06/mysqltuner-v090-is-now-available/</guid><description>MySQLTuner v0.9.0 is now available. There is a bug fix and also a new feature!
Fixed a bug in the enumeration/sizing of tables in MySQL 5
In MySQL 5 on some distributions, a NULL is returned for the storage engine and data length. Luuk Vosslamber quickly e-mailed me about the bug yesterday and it has been fixed.
MySQLTuner version checking
MySQLTuner will now check to see if a new version is available when the script runs.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner v0.8.9 is now available</title><link>https://major.io/2008/04/05/mysqltuner-v089-is-now-available/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2008 16:03:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/04/05/mysqltuner-v089-is-now-available/</guid><description>MySQLTuner v0.8.9 is now available. There are a few bug fixes, performance improvements, and readability adjustments.
Table enumeration and sizing can now be skipped
I&amp;rsquo;ve received reports that MySQLTuner will stall while enumerating tables on servers that contain a lot of tables or a lot of large tables. You can now use the --skipsize option to skip over the table enumeration process and let the script finish. However, you will not be able to receive some recommendations since the script was unable to determine which storage engines are enabled.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner v0.8.6 is now available</title><link>https://major.io/2008/02/26/mysqltuner-v086-is-now-available/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2008 03:24:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/02/26/mysqltuner-v086-is-now-available/</guid><description>Version 0.8.6 of MySQLTuner is now available. It contains a few bug fixes and readability improvements:
Newlines are placed between the sections for increased readability
Each section now contains extra lines to set the sections apart. It makes the output a little longer, but easier to read as well.
Storage engine status color bug
Even if the -nocolor option was passed, the storage engine statuses were being shown in color.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner now has a mailing list</title><link>https://major.io/2008/02/19/mysqltuner-now-has-a-mailing-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2008 02:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/02/19/mysqltuner-now-has-a-mailing-list/</guid><description>Due to popular demand, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a mailing list for MySQLTuner.

Here&amp;rsquo;s the changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.5 for MySQLTuner:
Fixed a copy/paste bug
There was a bug in 0.8.0 that displayed &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; in red rather than showing &amp;ldquo;!!&amp;rdquo;. It affected the informational &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo; outputs as well. Thanks to Nils Breunese for pointing out that confusing bug!
Fixed a data length calculation bug with MySQL 4.0

It was a quick fix, and the new version is now available for download.
Also, MySQLTuner now has a standardized versioning scheme. I&amp;rsquo;m starting at 0.8.0 since I&amp;rsquo;m close to a completely stable release. There&amp;rsquo;s still a few kinks when working with MySQL cluster nodes, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to work that out soon.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner reaches 5,000 downloads!</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/25/mysqltuner-reaches-5000-downloads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2008 17:01:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/25/mysqltuner-reaches-5000-downloads/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just reviewed the stats for MySQLTuner, and it crossed the 5,000 download mark last week! Thanks to all of you who have helped me make it a successful tool for MySQL server optimization.
With that said - how can MySQLTuner be improved to help you? Please let me know, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get started on those features!</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner Revision 29 is now available</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/15/mysqltuner-revision-29-is-now-available/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2008 04:13:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/15/mysqltuner-revision-29-is-now-available/</guid><description>A new version of MySQLTuner was released tonight to correct some bugs found within revision 26. As usual, you can get a new copy from the MySQLTuner site.
Here are the new features:
Â» Storage engine counts are shown
In addition to the actual size of the tables stored under each storage engine, there is a table count as well. The table count reflects the number of tables that exist on the server which use the specified storage engine.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner Revision 26 is now available</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/15/mysqltuner-revision-26-is-now-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2008 14:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/15/mysqltuner-revision-26-is-now-available/</guid><description>As some subversion users may have noticed, revision 23 of MySQLTuner was released quietly on Sunday. Thanks to Mike Jackson, a few bugs from revision 23 were smashed today and revision 26 was released this morning.
To pick up the new script, visit the MySQLTuner site.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the new features:
Â» Shows banner of enabled and disabled storage engines
Near the top of the MySQLTuner output, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a line like this:</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner is now a Debian package</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/08/mysqltuner-is-now-a-debian-package/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2008 16:37:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/08/mysqltuner-is-now-a-debian-package/</guid><description>I just received a note yesterday that MySQLTuner was added to Debian&amp;rsquo;s package list for the sid release.

Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the notable fixes and changes:
Â» Changed how indexes are calculated on MySQL 5
Thanks to Jon Hinds, I found that when running the tuning script against MySQL 5, the following SQL statement caused MySQL to open all of the tables on the server, which of course caused the table cache hit rate to plummet each time the script is run:</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner is now a Mandriva Linux package!</title><link>https://major.io/2007/11/30/mysqltuner-is-now-a-mandriva-linux-package/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2007 18:49:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2007/11/30/mysqltuner-is-now-a-mandriva-linux-package/</guid><description>Thanks to Oden Eriksson at Mandriva, MySQLTuner is now packaged into an RPM for easier installations on Mandriva Linux.
More data can be found in the Mandriva Linux Archives.
As an aside, I find it quite interesting that the first package for my script popped up on Mandriva. My first adventure into Linux was with Mandrake many years ago.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner Revision 20 is available</title><link>https://major.io/2007/11/06/mysqltuner-revision-20-is-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2007 23:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2007/11/06/mysqltuner-revision-20-is-available/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve updated MySQLTuner to revision 20 tonight, and it has the following improvements:
Added NetBSD support (thanks to Dave Burgess)
Switched username/password prompts to STDERR so they won&amp;rsquo;t appear in printouts

Here&amp;rsquo;s the main changes:
Adjusted infoprint to use asterisks (cosmetic)
Per-thread/global buffer counts are now displayed
Key buffer increases are only recommended if the buffer is smaller than total indexes and hit rate is &amp;lt; 95% * Dropped max_seeks_for_key checks * Temporary table size increases are not recommended over 256M * Aborted connection calculation and recommendation adjustments You can download the latest copy on the MySQLTuner page, and you can get diffs for the new version as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
