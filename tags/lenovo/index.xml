The T490 comes with an option where you can get a discrete Nvidia MX250 GPU and it packs plenty of power in a small footprint.
It also brings along a few issues.
Awful battery life There are many times where it would be helpful to fully disable the Nvidia card to extend battery life when graphics processing is not needed.</description></item><item><title>Thinkpad T490 Fedora install tips</title><link>https://major.io/2019/12/12/thinkpad-t490-fedora-install-tips/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/12/12/thinkpad-t490-fedora-install-tips/</guid><description>ðŸ”¨ WORK IN PROGRESS! I&amp;rsquo;m still finding some additional issues and I&amp;rsquo;ll write those up here as soon as I find some solutions.
Thinkpad T490 With my 4th Gen X1 Carbon beginning to age (especially the battery), it was time for an upgrade. I now have a T490 with a 10th gen Intel CPU and a discrete NVIDIA MX250 GPU. This laptop spec was just released on Black Friday!</description></item><item><title>Review: Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd generation and Linux</title><link>https://major.io/2015/03/30/review-lenovo-x1-carbon-3rd-generation-and-linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 14:15:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/03/30/review-lenovo-x1-carbon-3rd-generation-and-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://major.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ThinkPad-Carbon-X1.jpg" alt="1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a &lt;a href="../../2015/02/03/linux-support-dell-xps-13-9343-2015-model/">boatload of challenges&lt;/a> with what I thought would be my favorite Linux laptop, the &lt;a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-13-9343-laptop/pd">Dell XPS 13 9343&lt;/a>, I decided to take the plunge on a new &lt;a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/">Lenovo X1 Carbon (3rd gen)&lt;/a>. My late-2013 MacBook Pro Retina (MacbookPro11,1) had plenty of quirks when running Linux and I was eager to find a better platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fixing the Lenovo X1 Carbonâ€™s washed out display</title><link>https://major.io/2013/01/08/fixing-the-lenovo-x1-carbons-washed-out-display/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 16:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2013/01/08/fixing-the-lenovo-x1-carbons-washed-out-display/</guid><description>Although the X1 Carbon has a much better looking display than the T430s, it still looked a bit washed out when I compared it to other monitors right next to it. The entire display had a weak blue tint and it was difficult to use for extended periods, especially at maximum brightness.
A quick Google search took me to a LaunchPad entry about a better ICC profile for the X1 Carbon.</description></item><item><title>Handy settings for the touchpad/clickpad in the Lenovo X1 Carbon</title><link>https://major.io/2012/12/28/handy-settings-for-the-touchpadclickpad-in-the-lenovo-x1-carbon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2012 16:15:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/12/28/handy-settings-for-the-touchpadclickpad-in-the-lenovo-x1-carbon/</guid><description>UPDATE:I&amp;rsquo;ve found a better configuration via another X1 Carbon user and there&amp;rsquo;s a new post with all the details.
The Lenovo X1 Carbon comes with a pretty useful clickpad just below the keyboard, but the default synaptics settings in X from a Fedora 17 installation aren&amp;rsquo;t the best for this particular laptop. I found some tips about managing clickpads in a Github Gist about the Samsung Series 9 and I adjusted the values for the X1.</description></item></channel></rss>
