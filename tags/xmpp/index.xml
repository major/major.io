It was quite popular and its performance degraded over time as more users signed up and began posting updates. Eventually, Twitter killed the jabber bot altogether. Many users have asked when it will return.
Well, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t returned, but you can build your own replacement with ruby, a jabber account, and a few gems.</description></item></channel></rss>
