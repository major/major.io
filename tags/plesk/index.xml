Valid logins may be rejected, and they&amp;rsquo;ll appear in your /usr/local/psa/var/log/maillog as &amp;ldquo;no such user&amp;rdquo;. You can correct the issue by switching to long mail names (click Server -&amp;gt; Mail in Plesk), or you can run a shell script provided by Parallels.
For further details, refer to the Plesk KB article &amp;ldquo;Mail users cannot get or send mail after upgrade to Plesk 8.</description></item><item><title>Working hard on PleskHacker</title><link>https://major.io/2008/09/25/working-hard-on-pleskhacker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2008 17:00:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/09/25/working-hard-on-pleskhacker/</guid><description>Some of you may have already noticed from my Twitter feed, but I&amp;rsquo;ve started a complete re-write of pleskhacker.com in an easier-to-use format. The old site was done in Dokuwiki, and I found that it didn&amp;rsquo;t scale too well. The new site uses WordPress, and the performance is already improving.
Another improvement to the site is that it is now hosted on Mosso. This should allow the site to handle a lot more traffic and be more redundant than the original configuration.</description></item><item><title>SquirrelMail: 127 Can‚Äôt execute command</title><link>https://major.io/2008/09/08/squirrelmail-127-cant-execute-command/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2008 17:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/09/08/squirrelmail-127-cant-execute-command/</guid><description>I found a Plesk 8.3 server running RHEL 4 last month that was presenting errors when users attempted to send e-mail via SquirrelMail:

Unfortunately, clicking the FastCGI checkbox in Plesk won&amp;rsquo;t get you all of the support you need (and expect). The folks over at Parallels created a relatively simple process to get Ruby on Rails working properly on your site:
Go to your domain that you want to adjust, and click Setup. Make sure the CGI and FastCGI options are enabled.</description></item><item><title>Plesk 8.4.0: Unable to use short names for POP3/IMAP</title><link>https://major.io/2008/07/28/plesk-840-unable-to-use-short-names-for-pop3imap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2008 16:08:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/07/28/plesk-840-unable-to-use-short-names-for-pop3imap/</guid><description>If you recently upgraded to Plesk 8.4.0 with short names enabled, you may have found that it&amp;rsquo;s working with SMTP, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with POP3 or IMAP. There&amp;rsquo;s a bug in the Plesk version that prevents the courier configuration from being updated.
To correct the issue, first make sure that Plesk has short names enabled (Server &amp;gt; Mail). Once you&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed that Plesk thinks it&amp;rsquo;s enabled, add SHORTNAMES=1 to the following configuration files:</description></item><item><title>Rebuilding statistics from previous months on Plesk 8.3</title><link>https://major.io/2008/06/20/rebuilding-statistics-from-previous-months-on-plesk-83/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2008 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/06/20/rebuilding-statistics-from-previous-months-on-plesk-83/</guid><description>There was a bug in versions of Plesk prior to 8.3 where the AWStats statistics for the previous months were unavailable. It was a bug within Plesk&amp;rsquo;s AWStat&amp;rsquo;s implementation, and it was fixed in Plesk 8.3.
However, the fix only corrected the issue moving forward after the upgrade. There was no automated way to rebuild the previous months' statistics, even though the AWStats data was right there on the disk!</description></item><item><title>Why I use Plesk</title><link>https://major.io/2008/06/17/why-i-use-plesk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2008 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/06/17/why-i-use-plesk/</guid><description>It seems like I have a conversation like this one at least once a week:
Them: &amp;ldquo;Hey Major, you&amp;rsquo;re a pretty nerdy guy, what server distro do you use?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;I use CentOS 4 right now.&amp;rdquo;
Them: &amp;ldquo;CentOS? Why not use something more cutting edge, like Fedora or Gentoo?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Well, I like those, but Plesk works really well with CentOS.&amp;rdquo;
Them: &amp;ldquo;Seriously? You use Plesk? WHY?&amp;rdquo;
My CentOS server hosts a fair amount of domains for people I know and people I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description></item><item><title>Parallels Summit 2008 ‚Äì Day 1</title><link>https://major.io/2008/05/19/parallels-summit-2008-day-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2008 03:52:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/05/19/parallels-summit-2008-day-1/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying the Parallels Summit in Washington D.C. this week.

kill -ALRM `pgrep qmail-send` If for some peculiar reason you don&amp;rsquo;t have pgrep on your server, you can go about it a slightly different way:
kill -ALRM `ps ax | grep qmail-send | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'` Your logs should begin filling up with data about e-mails rolling through the queue.</description></item><item><title>After Plesk upgrade, ‚ÄúCannot initialize InnoDB‚Äù</title><link>https://major.io/2008/05/01/after-plesk-upgrade-cannot-initialize-innodb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 17:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/05/01/after-plesk-upgrade-cannot-initialize-innodb/</guid><description>Upgrading Plesk from 7.5.x to 8.x will change your Plesk-related MySQL tables from MyISAM to InnoDB. This allows for better concurrency in the Plesk panel when a lot of users are logged in simultaneously. However, some server administrators will disable InnoDB support in MySQL to save resources. This will cause problems after the upgrade.
Plesk may display an error on a white page that looks something like:

It&amp;rsquo;s always been a bit of a challenge to disable TRACE and TRACK methods with Plesk. The only available options were to create a ton of vhost.conf files or adjust the httpd.include files and prevent modifications with chattr (which is a bad idea on many levels).
Luckily, Parallels has made things easier with a new knowledge base article.</description></item><item><title>mchk: Unable to initialize quota settings for someuser@somedomain.com</title><link>https://major.io/2008/04/14/mchk-unable-to-initialize-quota-settings-for-someusersomedomaincom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 17:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/04/14/mchk-unable-to-initialize-quota-settings-for-someusersomedomaincom/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working in Plesk and you receive this error:

You can limit this size by adding a number to the /var/qmail/control/databytes file.
If you wanted to limit this to something like 10MB, you can just run the following command:
echo &amp;quot;10485760&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /var/qmail/control/databytes This will limit the size of messages (including attachments) to 10MB as a maximum.</description></item><item><title>Reduce iowait in Plesk: put qmail‚Äôs queue on a ramdisk</title><link>https://major.io/2008/03/14/reduce-iowait-in-plesk-put-qmails-queue-on-a-ramdisk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2008 18:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/03/14/reduce-iowait-in-plesk-put-qmails-queue-on-a-ramdisk/</guid><description>I really dislike qmail. But, since I use Plesk, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with it. However, I found a way to improve it&amp;rsquo;s awful mail queue performance by putting the mail queue onto a ramdisk. This is actually pretty darned easy to do.
First, toss a line like this into your /etc/fstab:
none /mailqueue tmpfs defaults,size=100m,nr_inodes=999k,mode=775 0 0 This will make a 100MB ramdisk on /mailqueue. Now, just symlink /var/qmail/mqueue to /mailqueue and move your e-mail over:</description></item><item><title>Plesk Professional Website Editor hangs at login</title><link>https://major.io/2008/03/13/plesk-professional-website-editor-hangs-at-login/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 18:11:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/03/13/plesk-professional-website-editor-hangs-at-login/</guid><description>One of my biggest Plesk gripes is dealing with the Plesk Professional Website Editor. One of the most common occurrences with PPWSE is that it hangs when you attempt to log into the server. Normally, this happens when a server is behind a firewall, and it is using private IP&amp;rsquo;s.
Plesk will actually query the DNS for the domain (rather than simply connecting to the localhost), try to reach the public IP, and the traffic will be blocked by the firewall.</description></item><item><title>Strange error with Horde 3.1.3 and Plesk 8.1.1</title><link>https://major.io/2008/03/10/strange-error-with-horde-313-and-plesk-811/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2008 02:49:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/03/10/strange-error-with-horde-313-and-plesk-811/</guid><description>I saw a ticket the other day where a customer received this error from Horde when trying to expand items on the left pane of the interface:

It turns out that Plesk 8.1.1 bundles Horde 3.1.3 which has an occasional bug within the interface. Upgrading to Plesk 8.2.0 corrects the issue as Horde 3.1.4 is installed with the upgrade.</description></item><item><title>High iowait on RHEL 4 with Plesk and SpamAssassin</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/31/high-iowait-on-rhel-4-with-plesk-and-spamassassin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2008 18:38:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/31/high-iowait-on-rhel-4-with-plesk-and-spamassassin/</guid><description>One of my biggest complaints on RHEL 4 is the large resource usage by the version of SpamAssassin that is installed. When it runs, it uses a ton of CPU time and causes a lot of disk I/O as well. When running top, you may see multiple spamd processes. For a high-volume e-mail server (like the one I administer), this is simply unacceptable.

If you install MySQL 5 on a version prior to 8.1.0, you may be able to access then panel in the other 8.x versions, but your upgrades will fail miserably.

The PHP include paths that appear in the Apache configuration generated by Plesk conflict with the PHP installation, and that causes the Horde webmail interface to segmentation fault.
To fix the problem, create a file called /etc/httpd/conf.d/zz050a_horde_php_workaround.conf and put the following inside it:
&amp;lt;DirectoryMatch /usr/share/psa-horde&amp;gt; php_admin_value include_path &amp;#34;/usr/share/psa-horde/lib:/usr/share/psa-horde:/usr/share/psa-horde/pear:.&amp;#34; &amp;lt;/DirectoryMatch&amp;gt; Reload the Apache configuration and your Horde installation should work properly with PHP 5.</description></item><item><title>Sort e-mail in Plesk with procmail</title><link>https://major.io/2007/11/27/sort-e-mail-in-plesk-with-procmail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2007 18:27:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2007/11/27/sort-e-mail-in-plesk-with-procmail/</guid><description>One of my biggest beefs with Plesk&amp;rsquo;s e-mail handling is the lack of server-side filtering. Plesk will only allow you to throw away e-mails marked as spam, but this won&amp;rsquo;t work for me since SpamAssassin marks some mails as spam that actually aren&amp;rsquo;t. If you set up filters in SquirrelMail or Horde, the filters will only work if you always log into the webmail interface to snag your e-mail.
Luckily, you can do some fancy work with procmail to have the filtering done server-side.</description></item><item><title>Plesk authorization failed: HTTP request error [7]</title><link>https://major.io/2007/11/14/plesk-authorization-failed-http-request-error-7/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2007 18:05:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2007/11/14/plesk-authorization-failed-http-request-error-7/</guid><description>I found myself wrestling with a server where the Plesk interface suddenly became unavailable without any user intervention.
