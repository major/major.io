Both of them drop off our home wireless network regularly. It causes lots of problems with various applications on the phones, especially casting video via Chromecast.
At the time when I first noticed the drops, I was using a pair of wireless access points (APs) from Engenius:

My criteria includes the following:
Needs to stay put on my ears, even when I get sweaty Wireless is preferable so I don&amp;rsquo;t get tangled For wireless, it should last three to four hours at a minimum It needs to sound decent The Bad I went through a slew of headphones.</description></item><item><title>Two months with Google Play Music All Access</title><link>https://major.io/2014/12/29/two-months-google-play-music-access/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 21:26:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/12/29/two-months-google-play-music-access/</guid><description>After using Spotify for a couple of months, I decided to try Google Play Music All Access. My experience was quite good from the start:
Music selection My music tastes include some very popular artists as well as some less popular ones. I found that Spotify and Google Play almost always had what I was looking for. Some artists only have portions of their catalog available for streaming and I found the selection of music in both products to be identical.</description></item><item><title>Log Android events remotely to a syslog server</title><link>https://major.io/2012/11/04/log-android-events-remotely-to-a-syslog-server/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2012 20:47:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/11/04/log-android-events-remotely-to-a-syslog-server/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m still quite pleased with my Samsung Galaxy SIII but there are some finicky Bluetooth issues with my car that I simply can&amp;rsquo;t figure out.

My phone is currently rooted with CyanogenMod 10 installed. Some of these steps will require rooting your device.</description></item><item><title>One week with Android</title><link>https://major.io/2012/09/06/one-week-with-android/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2012 03:53:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/09/06/one-week-with-android/</guid><description>After getting Android-envy at LinuxCon, I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and ditch my iPhone 4 for a Samsung Galaxy S III. It surprised a lot of people I know since I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big iPhone fan since the original model was released in 2007. I&amp;rsquo;ve carried the original iPhone, the 3GS, and then the 4. There have been good times and bad times, but the devices have served me pretty well overall.</description></item></channel></rss>
