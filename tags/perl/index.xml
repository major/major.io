Spamassassin stopped doing DNS lookups for RBL and SPF checks.
I had one of these moments:
My logs looked like this:

You can get it from the git repository or via these extremely simple methods:
wget -O mysqltuner.pl mysqltuner.pl wget --trust-server-names mysqltuner.pl There are a bunch of new features and fixes that you can find in the list of commits from today (2014-02-21). Some of the bigger adjustments include:

However, one of my biggest complaints is when it constantly confirms installing dependencies. While this is an annoyance if you have to install a module with many dependencies (or if you&amp;rsquo;re working with CPAN on a new server), you can tell CPAN to automatically confirm the installation of dependencies.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner 0.9.9 is now available</title><link>https://major.io/2008/09/07/mysqltuner-099-is-now-available/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2008 02:05:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/09/07/mysqltuner-099-is-now-available/</guid><description>MySQLTuner 0.9.9 is now available for download.

Use of uninitialized value in string eq at /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/VMware/VmPerl.pm line 114. You can run the vmware-cmd application with this error (it&amp;rsquo;s not a fatal error) and keep going with your normal business. However, if you want to remove the error, comment out lines 114 and 115 in the Perl module referenced by the error:</description></item><item><title>Adjusting CPAN mirror list</title><link>https://major.io/2008/06/16/adjusting-cpan-mirror-list/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2008 17:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/06/16/adjusting-cpan-mirror-list/</guid><description>One of the most frustrating aspects of CPAN is connecting to mirrors via FTP. Most of the time, the mirrors are extraordinarily slow when it comes to FTP logins, and they often fail. As we all know, RHEL enjoys pulling some shenanigans (Scalar::Util - enough said) when perl receives an upgrade, and when I need CPAN to work quickly, it often does the opposite.
I was struggling to find a way to reconfigure CPAN to use HTTP mirrors rather than FTP, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out where CPAN was holding this data.</description></item><item><title>Backing up MySQL to Amazonâ€™s S3</title><link>https://major.io/2008/06/05/backing-up-mysql-to-amazons-s3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2008 00:18:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/06/05/backing-up-mysql-to-amazons-s3/</guid><description>I received an e-mail from Tim Linden about a post he made in his blog about backing up MySQL data to Amazon&amp;rsquo;s S3.
The article goes over installing the Net::Amazon::S3 Perl module via WHM (which is handy for the cPanel users). However, if you&amp;rsquo;re not a cPanel user, you can install it via CPAN:
# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::Amazon::S3' If you&amp;rsquo;d rather install it through Webmin, go to the &amp;lsquo;Others&amp;rsquo; section, and click &amp;lsquo;Perl Modules&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Perl Issues: unable to call function somefunction on undefined value</title><link>https://major.io/2007/11/19/red-hat-perl-issues-unable-to-call-function-somefunction-on-undefined-value/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2007 18:19:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2007/11/19/red-hat-perl-issues-unable-to-call-function-somefunction-on-undefined-value/</guid><description>Apparently, a recent Red Hat Enterprise Linux update for ES3, 4 and 5 caused some Perl applications to throw errors like these:
unable to call function somefunction on undefined value Of course, replace somefunction with your function of choice. To correct the issue, you can force CPAN to bring back a more sane version of Scalar::Util:
