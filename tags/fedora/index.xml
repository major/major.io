They also serve as excellent methods for testing whether your application handles strings appropriately. (This can be a lot of fun.) ðŸ¤­
I constantly obsess with efficiency and shortening the time and effort required to get my work done. I noticed that I could type short text emoticons like :) and ;) so much faster than I could use emojis. This simply would not do.</description></item><item><title>Build AWS images with Image Builder</title><link>https://major.io/2020/06/19/build-aws-images-with-imagebuilder/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2020/06/19/build-aws-images-with-imagebuilder/</guid><description>The AMIs provided by most Linux distributions in AWS work well for most use cases. However, there are those times when you need a customized image to support a certain configuration or to speed up CI processes.
You can get a customized image via a few methods:
Build from an existing AMI, customize it, and snapshot it. Use an automated tool, such as Packer, to automate #1. Build your own image locally in KVM, VMware, or Virtualbox and upload the image into S3, import it into an EC2, and create an AMI from the snapshot.</description></item><item><title>Make diacritics easy in Linux</title><link>https://major.io/2020/02/13/make-diacritics-easy-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2020/02/13/make-diacritics-easy-in-linux/</guid><description>Diacritics are all of the small things that are added on, above, or below certain characters in various languages. Some examples include tildes (Ã±), accents (Ã¡), or other marks (Å¡). These marks are little hints that help you know how to pronounce a word properly (and they sometimes change the definition of a word entirely).
They are often skipped by non-native language speakers, and sometimes even by native speakers, but I have done my best to make a habit of including them when I can.</description></item><item><title>Disable Nvidia GPU on the Thinkpad T490</title><link>https://major.io/2020/01/24/disable-nvidia-gpu-thinkpad-t490/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2020/01/24/disable-nvidia-gpu-thinkpad-t490/</guid><description>I wrote about installing Linux on the Lenovo ThinkPad T490 last month and one of the biggest challenges was getting graphics working properly. The T490 comes with an option where you can get a discrete Nvidia MX250 GPU and it packs plenty of power in a small footprint.
It also brings along a few issues.
Awful battery life There are many times where it would be helpful to fully disable the Nvidia card to extend battery life when graphics processing is not needed.</description></item><item><title>Bring Back Fedora's Beefy Miracle boot splash</title><link>https://major.io/2019/12/16/bring-back-fedora-beefy-miracle-boot-splash.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/12/16/bring-back-fedora-beefy-miracle-boot-splash.md/</guid><description>Way back in 2012 when Fedora releases had names, there was one release that many of us in the Fedora community will never forget. Fedora 17&amp;rsquo;s code name was &amp;ldquo;Beefy Miracle&amp;rdquo; and it caused plenty of giggles and lots of consternation (especially in vegetarian and vegan circles).
No matter how you feel about the code name, the mascot was really good:

Some power supplies offer a monitoring interface where you can watch your power consumption in real time, but I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money.</description></item><item><title>Install Chromium with VAAPI on Fedora 30</title><link>https://major.io/2019/10/20/install-chromium-with-vaapi-on-fedora-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/10/20/install-chromium-with-vaapi-on-fedora-30/</guid><description>UPDATE: The chromium-vaapi package is now chromium-freeworld. This post was updated on 2019-11-06 to include the change. See the end of the post for the update steps.
If you use a web browser to watch videos on a laptop, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that some videos play without much impact on the battery. Other videos cause the fans to spin wildly and your battery life plummets.
Intel designed a specification called VA API, often called VAAPI (without the space), and it offers up device drivers to applications running on your system.</description></item><item><title>Customize GNOME from i3</title><link>https://major.io/2019/09/22/customize-gnome-from-i3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/09/22/customize-gnome-from-i3/</guid><description>i3 has been my window manager of choice for a while and I really enjoy its simplicity and ease of use.

Caching repositories, artifacts, and compiled objects makes kernel builds faster and it reduces infrastructure costs.
Need for speed We use GitLab CI in plenty of places, and that means we have a lot of gitlab-runner configurations for OpenShift (using the kubernetes executor) and AWS (using the docker-machine executor). The runner&amp;rsquo;s built-in caching makes it easy to upload and download cached items from object storage repositories like Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3.</description></item><item><title>buildah error: vfs driver does not support overlay.mountopt options</title><link>https://major.io/2019/08/13/buildah-error-vfs-driver-does-not-support-overlay-mountopt-options/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/08/13/buildah-error-vfs-driver-does-not-support-overlay-mountopt-options/</guid><description>Buildah and podman make a great pair for building, managing and running containers on a Linux system. You can even use them with GitLab CI with a few small adjustments, namely the switch from the overlayfs to vfs storage driver.
I have some regularly scheduled GitLab CI jobs that attempt to build fresh containers each morning and I use these to get the latest packages and find out early when something is broken in the build process.</description></item><item><title>Fedora 30 on Google Compute Engine</title><link>https://major.io/2019/08/07/fedora-30-on-google-compute-engine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/08/07/fedora-30-on-google-compute-engine/</guid><description>Fedora 30 is my primary operating system for desktops and servers, so I usually try to take it everywhere I go. I was recently doing some benchmarking for kernel compiles on different cloud plaforms and I noticed that Fedora isn&amp;rsquo;t included in Google Compute Engine&amp;rsquo;s default list of operating system images.
(Note: Fedora does include links to quick start an Amazon EC2 instance with their pre-built AMI&amp;rsquo;s. They are superb!)</description></item><item><title>Stop audio pops on Intel HD Audio</title><link>https://major.io/2019/03/04/stop-audio-pops-on-intel-hd-audio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/03/04/stop-audio-pops-on-intel-hd-audio/</guid><description>I recently picked up a Dell Optiplex 7060 and I&amp;rsquo;m using it as my main workstation now. The Fedora installation was easy, but I noticed a variety of &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; or clicking sounds when audio played, especially terminal bells.
If everything was quiet and I triggered a terminal bell, I would hear a loud pop just before the terminal bell sound. However, if I played music and then triggered a terminal bell, the pop was gone.</description></item><item><title>Automatic floating windows in i3</title><link>https://major.io/2019/02/08/automatic-floating-windows-in-i3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/02/08/automatic-floating-windows-in-i3/</guid><description>The i3 window manager is a fast window manager that helps you keep all of your applications in the right place. It automatically tiles windows and can manage those tiles across multiple virtual desktops.
However, there are certain applications that I really prefer in a floating window. Floating windows do not get tiled and they can easily be dragged around with your mouse. They&amp;rsquo;re the type of windows you expect to see on other non-tiling desktops such as GNOME or KDE.</description></item><item><title>Using the pressure stall information interface in kernel 4.20</title><link>https://major.io/2019/01/27/using-the-pressure-stall-information-interface-in-kernel-4.20/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/01/27/using-the-pressure-stall-information-interface-in-kernel-4.20/</guid><description>Fedora 29 now has kernel 4.20 available and it has lots of new features. One of the more interesting and easy to use features is the pressure stall information interface.
Load average We&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with the load average measurement on Linux machines, even if the numbers do seem a bit cryptic:
$ w 10:55:46 up 11 min, 1 user, load average: 0.42, 0.39, 0.26 The numbers denote how many processes were active over the last one, five and 15 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Running Home Assistant in a Docker container with a Z-Wave USB stick</title><link>https://major.io/2019/01/14/running-home-assistant-in-a-docker-container-with-zwave-usb-stick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/01/14/running-home-assistant-in-a-docker-container-with-zwave-usb-stick/</guid><description>The Home Assistant project provides a great open source way to get started with home automtion that can be entirely self-contained within your home.

You can manage rules for the IPv4 and IPv6 stacks using the same commands and it provides fine-grained controls for various &amp;ldquo;zones&amp;rdquo; of network sources and destinations.
Quick example Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of allowing an arbitrary port (for netdata) through the firewall with iptables and firewalld on Fedora:
## iptables iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 19999 ip6tables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 19999 service iptables save service ip6tables save ## firewalld firewall-cmd --add-port=19999/tcp --permanent In this example, firewall-cmd allows us to allow a TCP port through the firewall with a much simpler interface and the change is made permanent with the --permanent argument.</description></item><item><title>How to thrive at a technical conference</title><link>https://major.io/2018/05/09/how-to-thrive-at-a-tech-conference/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 23:54:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2018/05/09/how-to-thrive-at-a-tech-conference/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the 2018 Red Hat Summit this week in San Francisco and I am enjoying the interactions between developers, executives, vendors, and engineers.

However, there are those times when you may want to help with testing efforts or try out a new feature in a newer package.
Most of my systems have the updates-testing repository enabled in one way or another. This repository contains packages that package maintainers have submitted to become the next stable package in Fedora. For example, if there is a bug fix for nginx, the package maintainer submits the changes and publish a release.</description></item><item><title>Takeaways from my foray into amateur radio</title><link>https://major.io/2018/01/06/takeaways-from-my-foray-into-amateur-radio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 19:26:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2018/01/06/takeaways-from-my-foray-into-amateur-radio/</guid><description>The Overland Expo in Asheville last year was a great event, and one of my favorite sessions covered the basics about radio communications while overlanding.
