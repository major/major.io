I find this to be the easiest and most reliable way to upgrade a Fedora installation whether you use it as a server or desktop.
To reduce the total data downloaded, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend installing the yum-presto package first. It downloads delta RPM&amp;rsquo;s and builds them on the fly, which allows you to upgrade packages without having to download the entire RPM&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>Ugly upgrade path from WordPress 2.7.1 to 2.8</title><link>https://major.io/2009/06/13/ugly-upgrade-path-from-wordpress-2-7-1-to-2-8/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2009 17:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2009/06/13/ugly-upgrade-path-from-wordpress-2-7-1-to-2-8/</guid><description>When I tried to do an automatic upgrade from WordPress 2.7.1 to 2.8 yesterday, it failed miserably. The files were all put in place, but when I tried to load /wp-admin/upgrade.php, this error popped up:
I was perplexed at the error, so I restored from a backup and began upgrading manually. The manual upgrades have always worked well for me in the past, so I figured this would probably fix the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
