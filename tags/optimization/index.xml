ERROR 1206 (HY000): The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size
MySQL is trying to tell you that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough room to store all of the row locks that it would need to execute your query. The only way to fix it for sure is to adjust innodb_buffer_pool_size and restart MySQL.</description></item><item><title>WordPress + W3 Total Cache + MaxCDN How-To</title><link>https://major.io/2010/02/13/wordpress-w3-total-cache-maxcdn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2010 03:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/02/13/wordpress-w3-total-cache-maxcdn/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of WordPress as a blog and CMS platform. While it does have its problems, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple to set up, it&amp;rsquo;s extensible, and - when properly configured - it has great performance. The WP Super Cache plugin has been a staple on my WordPress blogs for quite some time and it has solved almost all of my performance problems.
However, when you load up quite a few plugins or a heavy theme, the performance will dip due to the increased number of stylesheets, javascript files, and images.</description></item></channel></rss>
