I tried upgrading the servers in place from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work so well. Those servers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t boot and the only recourse was a re-install.
Once I finished re-installing them (and wrestling with several installer bugs in Ubuntu 16.04), it was time to set up networking.</description></item><item><title>Tinkering with systemdâ€™s predictable network names</title><link>https://major.io/2016/01/20/tinkering-with-systemds-predictable-network-names/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2016 19:46:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/01/20/tinkering-with-systemds-predictable-network-names/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about predictable network names (and seemingly unpredictable ones) on the blog before, but some readers asked me how they could alter the network naming to fit a particular situation. Oddly enough, my Supermicro 5028D-T4NT has a problem with predictable names and it&amp;rsquo;s a great example to use here.
The problem There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of detail in my post about the Supermicro 5028D-T4NT, but the basic gist is that something within the firmware is causing the all of the network cards in the server to show up as onboard.</description></item><item><title>GRE tunnels with systemd-networkd</title><link>https://major.io/2015/10/16/gre-tunnels-with-systemd-networkd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2015 23:54:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/10/16/gre-tunnels-with-systemd-networkd/</guid><description>Switching to systemd-networkd for managing your networking interfaces makes things quite a bit simpler over standard networking scripts or NetworkManager. Aside from being easier to configure, it uses fewer resources on your system, which can be handy for smaller virtual machines or containers.
Managing tunnels between interfaces is also easier with systemd-networkd. This post will show you how to set up a GRE tunnel between two hosts running systemd-networkd.
Getting started You&amp;rsquo;ll need two hosts running a recent version of systemd-networkd.</description></item><item><title>Using systemd-networkd with bonding on Rackspaceâ€™s OnMetal servers</title><link>https://major.io/2015/08/21/using-systemd-networkd-with-bonding-on-rackspaces-onmetal-servers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/08/21/using-systemd-networkd-with-bonding-on-rackspaces-onmetal-servers/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about systemd-networkd in the past and how easy it can be to set up new network devices and tunnels. However, the documentation on systemd-networkd with bonding is a bit lacking (but I have a pull request pending for that).
Rackspace&amp;rsquo;s OnMetal Servers are a good place to test since they have bonded networks configured by default. They&amp;rsquo;re also quite fast and always fun for experiments.
To get started, head on over to the Rackspace Cloud control panel and build a compute-1 OnMetal server and choose Fedora 22 as your operating system.</description></item></channel></rss>
