As promised, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize the day and cover the talks which I attended.
The day started out with Jared Smith&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;State of Fedora&amp;rdquo; address. The audio has already been posted on the wiki, but the speech was very positive overall. He talked about some of the struggles that have happened in the past and how they&amp;rsquo;ll probably happen again in some form or another.</description></item></channel></rss>
