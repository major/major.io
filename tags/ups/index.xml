My new computer is a little more power hungry than my old one since I just moved to to a Ryzen 3700x and Nvidia GeForce 2060 and I like to keep tabs on how much energy it is consuming.
Some power supplies offer a monitoring interface where you can watch your power consumption in real time, but I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting CyberPower PowerPanel issues in Linux</title><link>https://major.io/2017/07/25/troubleshooting-cyberpower-powerpanel-issues-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:16:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2017/07/25/troubleshooting-cyberpower-powerpanel-issues-in-linux/</guid><description>I have a CyberPower BRG1350AVRLCD at home and I&amp;rsquo;ve just connected it to a new device. However, the pwrstat command doesn&amp;rsquo;t retrieve any useful data on the new system:
# pwrstat -status The UPS information shows as following: Current UPS status: State........................ Normal Power Supply by.............. Utility Power Last Power Event............. None I disconnected the USB cable and ran pwrstat again. Same output. I disconnected power from the UPS itself and ran pwrstat again.</description></item></channel></rss>
