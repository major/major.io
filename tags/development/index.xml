There were plenty of informative breakouts and some interesting keynotes.
Keynotes Beth Cohen shared some of the work that Verizon has done with software-defined WAN on customer-premises equipment (CPE). She showed a demo of how customers could easily provision virtual network hardware, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems, without waiting for hardware or cabling changes. I&amp;rsquo;m less familiar with the world of telcos, so I found this really interesting.</description></item><item><title>OpenStack isnâ€™t dead. Itâ€™s boring.

The first OpenStack Project Teams Gathering (PTG) event was held this week in Atlanta. The week was broken into two parts: cross-project work on Monday and Tuesday, and individual projects Wednesday through Friday. I was there for the first two days and heard a few discussions that started the same way.</description></item><item><title>Why should students learn to write code?</title><link>https://major.io/2016/10/10/why-should-students-learn-to-write-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 04:08:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/10/10/why-should-students-learn-to-write-code/</guid><description>There are lots of efforts underway to get students (young and old) to learn to write code. There are far-reaching efforts, like the Hour of Code, and plenty of smaller, more focused projects, such as the Design and Technology Academy (part of Northeast ISD here in San Antonio, Texas). These are excellent programs that enrich the education of many students.
I often hear a question from various people about these programs:</description></item><item><title>Whatâ€™s Happening in OpenStack-Ansible (WHOA) â€“ September 2016</title><link>https://major.io/2016/09/30/whats-happening-in-openstack-ansible-whoa-september-2016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 14:33:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/09/30/whats-happening-in-openstack-ansible-whoa-september-2016/</guid><description>Welcome to the fourth post in the series of What&amp;rsquo;s Happening in OpenStack-Ansible (WHOA) posts that I&amp;rsquo;m assembling each month.

The web interface works well for most users, but it can be challenging to use when you have a large amount of projects to monitor. I recently became a core developer on the OpenStack-Ansible project and I searched for a better solution to handle lots of active reviews.
This is where gertty can help.</description></item><item><title>Automated Letâ€™s Encrypt DNS challenges with Rackspace Cloud DNS</title><link>https://major.io/2016/03/31/automated-lets-encrypt-dns-challenges-with-rackspace-cloud-dns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2016 19:39:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/03/31/automated-lets-encrypt-dns-challenges-with-rackspace-cloud-dns/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt has taken the world by storm by providing free SSL certificates that can be renewed via automated methods.

A great question I joined several other local employers at the University of Texas at San Antonio last week for mock interviews with computer science students. We went through plenty of sample questions and gave feedback to the students on their content and delivery during the mock interviews.</description></item><item><title>Segmentation faults with sphinx and pyenv</title><link>https://major.io/2016/02/09/segmentation-faults-with-sphinx-and-pyenv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 14:09:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/02/09/segmentation-faults-with-sphinx-and-pyenv/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the pyenv project because it makes installing multiple python versions a simple process.

The collaborative process around creation, refinement, and even maintenance, drives more developers to work on open source software more often. However, every developer finds themselves writing code that very few people actually use.
For some developers, this can be really bothersome. You offer your code up to the world only to find that the world is much less interested than you expected.</description></item><item><title>Automated testing for Ansible CIS playbook on RHEL/CentOS 6</title><link>https://major.io/2015/08/05/automated-testing-for-ansible-cis-playbook-on-rhelcentos-6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 13:13:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/08/05/automated-testing-for-ansible-cis-playbook-on-rhelcentos-6/</guid><description>I started working on the Ansible CIS playbook for CentOS and RHEL 6 back in 2014 and I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes to increase quality and make it easier to use.
First off, the role itself is no longer a submodule. You can now just clone the repository and get rolling. This should reduce the time it takes to get started.
Also, all pull requests to the repository now go through integration testing at Rackspace.</description></item><item><title>Making things more super with supernova 2.0</title><link>https://major.io/2015/07/18/making-things-more-super-with-supernova-2-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2015 17:42:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/07/18/making-things-more-super-with-supernova-2-0/</guid><description>I started supernova a little over three years ago with the idea of making it easier to use novaclient. Three years and a few downloads later, it manages multiple different OpenStack clients, like nova, glance, and trove along with some handy features for users who manage a large number of environments.
What&amp;rsquo;s new? With some help from some friends who are much better at writing Python than I am (thanks Paul, Matt and Jason), I restructured supernova to make it more testable.</description></item><item><title>Improving LXC template security</title><link>https://major.io/2015/06/18/improving-lxc-template-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 19:52:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/06/18/improving-lxc-template-security/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting involved with the Fedora Security Team lately and we&amp;rsquo;re working as a group to crush security bugs that affect Fedora, CentOS (via EPEL) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (via EPEL). During some of this work, I stumbled upon a group of Red Hat Bugzilla tickets talking about LXC template security.
The gist of the problem is that there&amp;rsquo;s a wide variance in how users and user credentials are handled by the different LXC templates.</description></item><item><title>Lessons learned from a kernel bisection</title><link>https://major.io/2015/02/09/lessons-learned-kernel-bisection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 14:39:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/02/09/lessons-learned-kernel-bisection/</guid><description>[][1]I&amp;rsquo;m far from being a kernel developer, but I found myself staring down a [peculiar touchpad problem][2] with my new Dell XPS 13. Before kernel 3.17, the touchpad showed up as a standard PS/2 mouse, which certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal. That robbed the pad of its multi-touch capabilities. Kernel 3.17 added the right support for the pad but freezes began to occur somewhere between 3.17 and 3.19.

Here&amp;rsquo;s a link:
Red Hat confuses Linux users with latest Fedora moves
The article dives into the productization of Fedora 21 that hopes to deliver a better experience for workstation, server, and cloud users. The article suggests that Red Hat drove Fedora development and that the goals of Red Hat and Fedora are closely aligned.</description></item><item><title>Audit RHEL/CentOS 6 security benchmarks with ansible</title><link>https://major.io/2014/08/19/audit-rhelcentos-6-security-benchmarks-ansible/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2014 12:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/08/19/audit-rhelcentos-6-security-benchmarks-ansible/</guid><description>Securing critical systems isn&amp;rsquo;t easy and that&amp;rsquo;s why security benchmarks exist. Many groups and communities distribute recommendations for securing servers, including NIST, the US Department of Defense (DoD), and the Center for Internet Security (CIS).
Although NIST and DoD are catching up quickly with newer OS releases, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the CIS benchmarks are updated very regularly. CIS distributes auditing tools (with paid memberships) that require Java and they&amp;rsquo;re cumbersome to use, especially on servers where Java isn&amp;rsquo;t normally installed.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in live booting Linux distributions</title><link>https://major.io/2014/07/29/adventures-in-live-booting-linux-distributions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2014 13:05:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/07/29/adventures-in-live-booting-linux-distributions/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with live booting Linux distributions. Almost every Linux distribution under the sun has a method for making live CD&amp;rsquo;s, writing live USB sticks, or booting live images over the network. The primary use case for some distributions is on a live medium (like KNOPPIX).
However, I embarked on an adventure to look at live booting Linux for a different use case. Sure, many live environments are used for demonstrations or installations - temporary activities for a desktop or a laptop.</description></item><item><title>Enjoy supernova 1.0.0</title><link>https://major.io/2014/05/27/enjoy-supernova-1-0-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2014 13:19:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/05/27/enjoy-supernova-1-0-0/</guid><description>The first supernova commit to GitHub appeared just over two years ago.

One common theme that kept cropping up was around bringing DevOps to the enterprise. I stumbled upon Mathias Meyer&amp;rsquo;s post, The Developer is Dead, Long Live the Developer, and I was inspired to write my own.
Before I go any further, here&amp;rsquo;s my definition of DevOps: it&amp;rsquo;s a mindset shift where everyone is responsible for the success of the customer experience.</description></item><item><title>Xen hackathon coming up in London</title><link>https://major.io/2014/03/27/xen-hackathon-coming-up-in-london/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 13:20:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/03/27/xen-hackathon-coming-up-in-london/</guid><description>If you enjoy using Xen, join members of the Xen Project community and Rackspace at the Xen Hackathon in London.

After downloading the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 security benchmark PDF, I quickly started to see the value of the document. Some of the standards were the installation defaults, some were often forgotten settings, and some were completely brand new to me.
Automating the standards can be a little treacherous simply due to the number of things to adjust and check.</description></item></channel></rss>
