While it does have its problems, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple to set up, it&amp;rsquo;s extensible, and - when properly configured - it has great performance. The WP Super Cache plugin has been a staple on my WordPress blogs for quite some time and it has solved almost all of my performance problems.
However, when you load up quite a few plugins or a heavy theme, the performance will dip due to the increased number of stylesheets, javascript files, and images.</description></item></channel></rss>
