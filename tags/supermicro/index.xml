Oddly enough, my Supermicro 5028D-T4NT has a problem with predictable names and it&amp;rsquo;s a great example to use here.
The problem There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of detail in my post about the Supermicro 5028D-T4NT, but the basic gist is that something within the firmware is causing the all of the network cards in the server to show up as onboard.</description></item><item><title>Customizing systemdâ€™s network device names</title><link>https://major.io/2015/09/28/customizing-systemds-network-device-names/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 02:08:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/09/28/customizing-systemds-network-device-names/</guid><description>Earlier today, I wrote a post about my first thoughts on the Supermicro 5028D-T4NT server. The 10Gb interfaces on the server came up with the names eth0 and eth1. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I expected. There&amp;rsquo;s tons of detail on the problem in the blog post as well as the Github issue.
Kay Sievers gave a hint about how to adjust the interfacing naming in a more granular way than simply disabling the predictable network names.</description></item><item><title>First thoughts: Linux on the Supermicro 5028D-TN4T</title><link>https://major.io/2015/09/28/first-thoughts-linux-on-the-supermicro-5028d-t4nt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 12:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/09/28/first-thoughts-linux-on-the-supermicro-5028d-t4nt/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved over to Rackspace&amp;rsquo;s OpenStack Private Cloud team and the role is full of some great challenges. One of those challenges was figuring out a home lab for testing.
The search My first idea was to pick up some lower-power machines that would give me some infrastructure at a low price with a low power bill as well. I found some Dell Optiplex 3020&amp;rsquo;s on Newegg with Haswell i3&amp;rsquo;s that came in at a good price point.</description></item></channel></rss>
