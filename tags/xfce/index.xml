I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to find a barebones, auto-completing application launcher in Linux for quite some time. My search has ended with dmenu.
I stumbled upon dmenu after trying out the i3 tiling window manager and I was hooked almost immediately. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely fast, unobtrusive, and the auto-completion is really intuitive. Another added bonus is that there is no daemon or window manager hook required for the launcher to operate.</description></item></channel></rss>
