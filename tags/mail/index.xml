The monospace font used for plain text messages was difficult to read.
I opened Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Display and clicked Advanced to the right of Fonts &amp;amp; Colors. The default font for monospace text was &amp;ldquo;Monospace&amp;rdquo;, and that one isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly attractive.</description></item><item><title>Thunderbird opens multiple windows</title><link>https://major.io/2016/04/20/thunderbird-opens-multiple-windows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 13:31:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/04/20/thunderbird-opens-multiple-windows/</guid><description>When I started Thunderbird today, it opened three windows. Each window was identical. I closed two of them and then quit Thunderbird.
As soon as I started Thunderbird, I had three windows again.
I found a Mozilla bug report from 2015 that had some tips for getting the additional windows closed.
Choose one of the open Thunderbird windows and select Close from the File menu. Do not use ALT-F4 or CTRL-W to close the window.</description></item><item><title>Custom keyboard shortcuts for Evolution in GNOME</title><link>https://major.io/2015/11/27/custom-keyboard-shortcuts-for-evolution-in-gnome/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2015 05:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/11/27/custom-keyboard-shortcuts-for-evolution-in-gnome/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big fan of Thunderbird for years, but it lacks features in some critical areas. For example, I need Microsoft Exchange and Google Apps connectivity for my mail and contacts, but Thunderbird needs some extensions to make that connectivity easier. There are some great extensions available, but they lack polish since they&amp;rsquo;re not part of the core product.
My muscle memory for keyboard shortcuts in Thunderbird left me fumbling in Evolution.</description></item><item><title>Fixing broken DNS lookups in spamassassin</title><link>https://major.io/2014/06/20/fixing-broken-dns-lookups-in-spamassassin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 13:20:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/06/20/fixing-broken-dns-lookups-in-spamassassin/</guid><description>I talked about the joys of running my own mail server last week only to find that my mail server was broken yesterday.

One of my coworkers noticed that my Apple Mail client displays the X-Originating-IP header for all of the emails I receive.
You can enter that IP into a whois search and get a better idea of who sent you the message without diving into the headers. If someone that regularly exchanges email with me suddenly has an originating IP in another country that would be unusual for them to travel to, I can approach the message with more caution.</description></item><item><title>Remove sensitive information from email headers with postfix</title><link>https://major.io/2013/04/14/remove-sensitive-information-from-email-headers-with-postfix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2013 02:59:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2013/04/14/remove-sensitive-information-from-email-headers-with-postfix/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of moving back to a postfix/dovecot setup for hosting my own mail and I wanted a way to remove the more sensitive email headers that are normally generated when I send mail. My goal is to hide the originating IP address of my mail as well as my mail client type and version.
To get started, make a small file with regular expressions in /etc/postfix/header_checks:
/^Received:.*with ESMTPSA/ IGNORE /^X-Originating-IP:/ IGNORE /^X-Mailer:/ IGNORE /^Mime-Version:/ IGNORE The &amp;ldquo;ESMTPSA&amp;rdquo; match works for me because I only send email via port 465.</description></item><item><title>SELinux and .forward files</title><link>https://major.io/2012/01/02/selinux-and-forward-files/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2012 22:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/01/02/selinux-and-forward-files/</guid><description>If you want to forward e-mail from root to another user, you can usually place a .forward file in root&amp;rsquo;s home directory and your mail server will take care of the rest:

Valid logins may be rejected, and they&amp;rsquo;ll appear in your /usr/local/psa/var/log/maillog as &amp;ldquo;no such user&amp;rdquo;.

kill -ALRM `pgrep qmail-send` If for some peculiar reason you don&amp;rsquo;t have pgrep on your server, you can go about it a slightly different way:
kill -ALRM `ps ax | grep qmail-send | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'` Your logs should begin filling up with data about e-mails rolling through the queue.</description></item><item><title>mchk: Unable to initialize quota settings for someuser@somedomain.com</title><link>https://major.io/2008/04/14/mchk-unable-to-initialize-quota-settings-for-someusersomedomaincom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 17:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/04/14/mchk-unable-to-initialize-quota-settings-for-someusersomedomaincom/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working in Plesk and you receive this error:

You can limit this size by adding a number to the /var/qmail/control/databytes file.
If you wanted to limit this to something like 10MB, you can just run the following command:
echo &amp;quot;10485760&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /var/qmail/control/databytes This will limit the size of messages (including attachments) to 10MB as a maximum.</description></item><item><title>Reduce iowait in Plesk: put qmail‚Äôs queue on a ramdisk</title><link>https://major.io/2008/03/14/reduce-iowait-in-plesk-put-qmails-queue-on-a-ramdisk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2008 18:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/03/14/reduce-iowait-in-plesk-put-qmails-queue-on-a-ramdisk/</guid><description>I really dislike qmail. But, since I use Plesk, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with it. However, I found a way to improve it&amp;rsquo;s awful mail queue performance by putting the mail queue onto a ramdisk. This is actually pretty darned easy to do.
First, toss a line like this into your /etc/fstab:
none /mailqueue tmpfs defaults,size=100m,nr_inodes=999k,mode=775 0 0 This will make a 100MB ramdisk on /mailqueue. Now, just symlink /var/qmail/mqueue to /mailqueue and move your e-mail over:</description></item><item><title>sendmail: savemail panic</title><link>https://major.io/2008/02/18/sendmail-savemail-panic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2008 18:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/02/18/sendmail-savemail-panic/</guid><description>If you see a large mail queue and your system&amp;rsquo;s I/O is increasing, you may find messages like these in your syslog:
Losing q5/qfg9N5EwE3004499: savemail panic&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; SYSERR(root): savemail: cannot save rejected email anywhere
In this situation, there&amp;rsquo;s some reason why sendmail cannot deliver e-mail to the postmaster address. There&amp;rsquo;s a few issues that can create this problem:
Missing postmaster alias in /etc/aliases Hard disk is full The mail spool for the postmaster has the wrong ownership The mbox file for the postmaster is over 2GB and procmail can&amp;rsquo;t deliver the e-mail First, correct the situation that is preventing sendmail from delivering the e-mail to the postmaster user.</description></item><item><title>High iowait on RHEL 4 with Plesk and SpamAssassin</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/31/high-iowait-on-rhel-4-with-plesk-and-spamassassin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2008 18:38:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/31/high-iowait-on-rhel-4-with-plesk-and-spamassassin/</guid><description>One of my biggest complaints on RHEL 4 is the large resource usage by the version of SpamAssassin that is installed. When it runs, it uses a ton of CPU time and causes a lot of disk I/O as well. When running top, you may see multiple spamd processes. For a high-volume e-mail server (like the one I administer), this is simply unacceptable.
I decided to do something about it, and here are the steps:</description></item><item><title>Can‚Äôt enable DNSBL/RBL in Plesk because it‚Äôs greyed out</title><link>https://major.io/2008/01/25/cant-enable-dnsblrbl-in-plesk-because-its-greyed-out/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2008 17:11:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/01/25/cant-enable-dnsblrbl-in-plesk-because-its-greyed-out/</guid><description>If you have a new Plesk installation and the following option is greyed out in Server -&amp;gt; Mail:

Plesk will only allow you to throw away e-mails marked as spam, but this won&amp;rsquo;t work for me since SpamAssassin marks some mails as spam that actually aren&amp;rsquo;t. If you set up filters in SquirrelMail or Horde, the filters will only work if you always log into the webmail interface to snag your e-mail.
Luckily, you can do some fancy work with procmail to have the filtering done server-side.</description></item><item><title>clamdscan: corrupt or unknown clamd scanner error or memory/resource/perms problem</title><link>https://major.io/2007/11/16/clamdscan-corrupt-or-unknown-clamd-scanner-error-or-memoryresourceperms-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2007 18:11:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2007/11/16/clamdscan-corrupt-or-unknown-clamd-scanner-error-or-memoryresourceperms-problem/</guid><description>A few days ago, I stumbled upon a server running qmail with qmail-scanner.
