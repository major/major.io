The DRBD kernel module for kernel 3.10 is up to 8.4.3 but the client tools within Fedora 19 (currently at 8.4.2) should work fine. The API versions are the same for both the kernel modules and user tools.
If you&amp;rsquo;re eager to see a changelog between 8.4.2 and 8.4.3, check DRBD&amp;rsquo;s git repository. The majority of the changes are within the kernel module itself.</description></item><item><title>drbd 8.4.2 for Fedora 17</title><link>https://major.io/2013/03/31/drbd-8-4-2-for-fedora-17/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 17:35:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2013/03/31/drbd-8-4-2-for-fedora-17/</guid><description>Fedora 17 DRBD users should see version 8.4.2 of the DRBD client tools make it into stable repositories soon. This fixes a bug caused when the kernel version was bumped to 3.8 and the kernel module no longer matched the tools. It&amp;rsquo;s the same problem that recently cropped up on Fedora 18.</description></item><item><title>drbd 8.4.2 for Fedora 18</title><link>https://major.io/2013/03/15/drbd-8-4-2-for-fedora-18/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 12:28:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2013/03/15/drbd-8-4-2-for-fedora-18/</guid><description>If you use DRBD on Fedora 18, there&amp;rsquo;s a new client tools package on its way to the stable repositories. The kernel module for DRBD was bumped to 8.4.2 and the client tools have been updated to match it.
This fixes a bug that was submitted earlier this month.</description></item><item><title>Switching from GlusterFS to DRBD and OCFS2</title><link>https://major.io/2010/11/10/switching-from-glusterfs-to-drbd-and-ocfs2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2010 13:55:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/11/10/switching-from-glusterfs-to-drbd-and-ocfs2/</guid><description>As my uptime reports have shown, and as some of you have reported, my blog&amp;rsquo;s load time has increased steadily over the past few weeks. It turns out that one of my VM&amp;rsquo;s was on a physical machine that had some trouble and I was reaching a point where GlusterFS&amp;rsquo;s replicate functionality couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet my performance needs.
Instead of using GlusterFS as I had before in my redundant cloud hosting guide, I decided to use DRBD in dual-primary mode with OCFS2 as the clustering filesystem on top of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
