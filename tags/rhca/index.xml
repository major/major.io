Please feel free to leave your comments at the end of the post. Sometimes people talk to me about posts I&amp;rsquo;ve written on my blog, or posts they wish I would write. At some point during the discussion, I&amp;rsquo;ll almost always ask the person why they don&amp;rsquo;t start up their own blog or contribute to someone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>The Kerberos-haterâ€™s guide to installing Kerberos</title><link>https://major.io/2012/02/05/the-kerberos-haters-guide-to-installing-kerberos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2012 21:03:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/02/05/the-kerberos-haters-guide-to-installing-kerberos/</guid><description>As promised in my earlier post entitled Kerberos for haters, I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled the simplest possible guide to get Kerberos up an running on two CentOS 5 servers.
Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t really hate Kerberos. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an inside joke with my coworkers who are studying for some of the RHCA exams at Rackspace. The additional security provided by Kerberos is quite good but the setup involves a lot of small steps.</description></item><item><title>Kerberos for haters</title><link>https://major.io/2012/02/02/kerberos-for-haters/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2012 04:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/02/02/kerberos-for-haters/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first one to admit that Kerberos drives me a little insane. It&amp;rsquo;s a requirement for two of the exams in Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s RHCA certification track and I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to learn it. It provides some pretty nice security features for large server environments. You get central single sign ons, encrypted authentication, and bidirectional validation. However, getting it configured can be a real pain due to some rather archaic commands and shells.</description></item><item><title>One RHCA exam down, five to go</title><link>https://major.io/2011/01/06/one-rhca-exam-down-five-to-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2011 02:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/01/06/one-rhca-exam-down-five-to-go/</guid><description>While I&amp;rsquo;m not the biggest proponent of certifications, I still think you can learn some valuable information while studying for some certification tests. A good example of that is Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s System Monitoring and Performance Tuning Expertise Exam. It&amp;rsquo;s one test out of five in the Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) track of exams. I passed the exam this week and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the most difficult certification exams I&amp;rsquo;ve ever taken.</description></item></channel></rss>
