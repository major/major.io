If you are new to options trading, you may want to start with some of my earlier posts.
After writing my original blog post about selling options contracts in the stock market, I received some feedback saying that the post jumped over too many steps and used too much terminology. I went back, re-read the post, and found lots of room for improvement.</description></item><item><title>Monitor a UPS with a Raspberry Pi Zero W</title><link>https://major.io/2021/03/15/monitor-ups-with-raspberry-pi-zero-w/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2021/03/15/monitor-ups-with-raspberry-pi-zero-w/</guid><description>After the recent snow apocalypse that swept through Texas followed by widespread power crisis, I realized that my UPS monitoring strategy needed improvement. One had batteries that were near death and my other two had loads that were not well balanced.
I have a few CyberPower UPS units and an old APC UPS. Although CyberPower does offer relatively expensive monitoring cards that puts the UPS on the local network, none of them worked with my 1350/1500VA units.</description></item><item><title>Build AWS images with Image Builder</title><link>https://major.io/2020/06/19/build-aws-images-with-imagebuilder/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2020/06/19/build-aws-images-with-imagebuilder/</guid><description>The AMIs provided by most Linux distributions in AWS work well for most use cases. However, there are those times when you need a customized image to support a certain configuration or to speed up CI processes.
You can get a customized image via a few methods:
Build from an existing AMI, customize it, and snapshot it. Use an automated tool, such as Packer, to automate #1. Build your own image locally in KVM, VMware, or Virtualbox and upload the image into S3, import it into an EC2, and create an AMI from the snapshot.</description></item><item><title>Make diacritics easy in Linux</title><link>https://major.io/2020/02/13/make-diacritics-easy-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2020/02/13/make-diacritics-easy-in-linux/</guid><description>Diacritics are all of the small things that are added on, above, or below certain characters in various languages. Some examples include tildes (√±), accents (√°), or other marks (≈°). These marks are little hints that help you know how to pronounce a word properly (and they sometimes change the definition of a word entirely).
They are often skipped by non-native language speakers, and sometimes even by native speakers, but I have done my best to make a habit of including them when I can.</description></item><item><title>Disable Nvidia GPU on the Thinkpad T490</title><link>https://major.io/2020/01/24/disable-nvidia-gpu-thinkpad-t490/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2020/01/24/disable-nvidia-gpu-thinkpad-t490/</guid><description>I wrote about installing Linux on the Lenovo ThinkPad T490 last month and one of the biggest challenges was getting graphics working properly. The T490 comes with an option where you can get a discrete Nvidia MX250 GPU and it packs plenty of power in a small footprint.
It also brings along a few issues.
Awful battery life There are many times where it would be helpful to fully disable the Nvidia card to extend battery life when graphics processing is not needed.</description></item><item><title>Bring Back Fedora's Beefy Miracle boot splash</title><link>https://major.io/2019/12/16/bring-back-fedora-beefy-miracle-boot-splash.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/12/16/bring-back-fedora-beefy-miracle-boot-splash.md/</guid><description>Way back in 2012 when Fedora releases had names, there was one release that many of us in the Fedora community will never forget. Fedora 17&amp;rsquo;s code name was &amp;ldquo;Beefy Miracle&amp;rdquo; and it caused plenty of giggles and lots of consternation (especially in vegetarian and vegan circles).
No matter how you feel about the code name, the mascot was really good:

One aspect of both that is often overlooked is scheduled jobs, or cron jobs. ‚è∞
Cron jobs in OpenShift allow you to run certain containers on a regular basis and execute certain applications or scripts in those containers. You can use them to trigger GitLab CI pipelines, run certain housekeeping tasks in web applications, or run backups.</description></item><item><title>Monitor CyberPower UPS wattage</title><link>https://major.io/2019/11/08/monitor-cyberpower-ups-wattage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/11/08/monitor-cyberpower-ups-wattage/</guid><description>I have a CyberPower CP1350AVRLCD under my desk at home and I use it to run my computer, monitors, speakers, and a lamp. My new computer is a little more power hungry than my old one since I just moved to to a Ryzen 3700x and Nvidia GeForce 2060 and I like to keep tabs on how much energy it is consuming.
Some power supplies offer a monitoring interface where you can watch your power consumption in real time, but I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to spend that much money.</description></item><item><title>Install Chromium with VAAPI on Fedora 30</title><link>https://major.io/2019/10/20/install-chromium-with-vaapi-on-fedora-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/10/20/install-chromium-with-vaapi-on-fedora-30/</guid><description>UPDATE: The chromium-vaapi package is now chromium-freeworld. This post was updated on 2019-11-06 to include the change. See the end of the post for the update steps.
If you use a web browser to watch videos on a laptop, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that some videos play without much impact on the battery. Other videos cause the fans to spin wildly and your battery life plummets.
Intel designed a specification called VA API, often called VAAPI (without the space), and it offers up device drivers to applications running on your system.</description></item><item><title>Customize GNOME from i3</title><link>https://major.io/2019/09/22/customize-gnome-from-i3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/09/22/customize-gnome-from-i3/</guid><description>i3 has been my window manager of choice for a while and I really enjoy its simplicity and ease of use. I use plenty of gtk applications, such as Firefox and Evolution, and configuring them within i3 can be confusing.

Deploying monit is easy. There&amp;rsquo;s only one binary daemon to run and it reads monitoring configuration from files in a directory you specify.
Most Linux distributions have a package for monit and the package usually contains some basic configuration along with a systemd unit file to run the daemon reliably.
However, this post is all about how to deploy it inside OpenShift.</description></item><item><title>Get faster GitLab runners with a ramdisk</title><link>https://major.io/2019/08/16/get-faster-gitlab-runners-with-a-ramdisk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/08/16/get-faster-gitlab-runners-with-a-ramdisk/</guid><description>When you build tons of kernels every day like my team does, you look for speed improvements anywhere you can. Caching repositories, artifacts, and compiled objects makes kernel builds faster and it reduces infrastructure costs.
Need for speed We use GitLab CI in plenty of places, and that means we have a lot of gitlab-runner configurations for OpenShift (using the kubernetes executor) and AWS (using the docker-machine executor). The runner&amp;rsquo;s built-in caching makes it easy to upload and download cached items from object storage repositories like Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3.</description></item><item><title>buildah error: vfs driver does not support overlay.mountopt options</title><link>https://major.io/2019/08/13/buildah-error-vfs-driver-does-not-support-overlay-mountopt-options/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/08/13/buildah-error-vfs-driver-does-not-support-overlay-mountopt-options/</guid><description>Buildah and podman make a great pair for building, managing and running containers on a Linux system. You can even use them with GitLab CI with a few small adjustments, namely the switch from the overlayfs to vfs storage driver.
I have some regularly scheduled GitLab CI jobs that attempt to build fresh containers each morning and I use these to get the latest packages and find out early when something is broken in the build process.</description></item><item><title>Fedora 30 on Google Compute Engine</title><link>https://major.io/2019/08/07/fedora-30-on-google-compute-engine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/08/07/fedora-30-on-google-compute-engine/</guid><description>Fedora 30 is my primary operating system for desktops and servers, so I usually try to take it everywhere I go. I was recently doing some benchmarking for kernel compiles on different cloud plaforms and I noticed that Fedora isn&amp;rsquo;t included in Google Compute Engine&amp;rsquo;s default list of operating system images.
(Note: Fedora does include links to quick start an Amazon EC2 instance with their pre-built AMI&amp;rsquo;s. They are superb!)</description></item><item><title>Ham Radio FAQ</title><link>https://major.io/ham-radio-faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/ham-radio-faq/</guid><description>Welcome!

The world of amateur, or ham, radio is huge and it&amp;rsquo;s what you want to make of it. The itch struck me in the middle of 2017 and I learned a lot since then.

Fortunately, GitLab offers up CI to build containers and a container registry in every repository to hold the containers we build.
This is really handy because it keeps everything together in one place: your container build scripts, your container build infrastructure, and the registry that holds your containers. Better yet, you can put multiple types of containers underneath a single git repository if you need to build containers based on different Linux distributions.</description></item><item><title>Inspecting OpenShift cgroups from inside the pod</title><link>https://major.io/2019/04/05/inspecting-openshift-cgroups-from-inside-the-pod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/04/05/inspecting-openshift-cgroups-from-inside-the-pod/</guid><description>My team at Red Hat builds a lot of kernels in OpenShift pods as part of our work with the Continuous Kernel Integration (CKI) project. We have lots of different pod sizes depending on the type of work we are doing and our GitLab runners spawn these pods based on the tags in our GitLab CI pipeline.
Compiling with make When you compile a large software project, such as the Linux kernel, you can use multiple CPU cores to speed up the build.</description></item><item><title>Get a /56 from Spectrum using wide-dhcpv6</title><link>https://major.io/2019/03/19/get-a-slash-56-from-spectrum-using-wide-dhcpv6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/03/19/get-a-slash-56-from-spectrum-using-wide-dhcpv6/</guid><description>After writing my last post on my IPv6 woes with my Pixel 3, some readers asked how I&amp;rsquo;m handling IPv6 on my router lately.

The Fedora installation was easy, but I noticed a variety of &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; or clicking sounds when audio played, especially terminal bells.
If everything was quiet and I triggered a terminal bell, I would hear a loud pop just before the terminal bell sound. However, if I played music and then triggered a terminal bell, the pop was gone.</description></item><item><title>Automatic floating windows in i3</title><link>https://major.io/2019/02/08/automatic-floating-windows-in-i3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/02/08/automatic-floating-windows-in-i3/</guid><description>The i3 window manager is a fast window manager that helps you keep all of your applications in the right place. It automatically tiles windows and can manage those tiles across multiple virtual desktops.
However, there are certain applications that I really prefer in a floating window. Floating windows do not get tiled and they can easily be dragged around with your mouse. They&amp;rsquo;re the type of windows you expect to see on other non-tiling desktops such as GNOME or KDE.</description></item><item><title>DevConf.CZ 2019 Recap</title><link>https://major.io/2019/01/31/devconf.cz-2019-recap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2019/01/31/devconf.cz-2019-recap/</guid><description>DevConf.CZ 2019 wrapped up last weekend and it was a great event packed with lots of knowledgeable speakers, an engaging hallway track, and delicious food.
