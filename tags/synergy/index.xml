I have a MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard that acts as a synergy server and a desktop running Fedora 12 as a synergy client. On the Mac, I use SynergyKM to manage the synergy server. The Fedora box uses my gdm strategy for starting synergy at the login screen and in GNOME.
I kept having an issue where the shift key would become stuck regardless of the settings I set for the client or server.</description></item><item><title>Automatically starting synergy in GDM in Ubuntu/Fedora</title><link>https://major.io/2008/07/30/automatically-starting-synergy-in-gdm-in-ubuntufedora/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2008 17:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/07/30/automatically-starting-synergy-in-gdm-in-ubuntufedora/</guid><description>Before you follow this guide, be sure to read about the issue I had in Fedora 12 with this strategy.
At work, I have a Mac Mini as my main workstation with one monitor. There&amp;rsquo;s another monitor to the right which is connected to my Linux box. I run a synergy server on the Mac, and I run a synergy client in Linux. However, I was getting pretty frustrated when I&amp;rsquo;d have to manually start the synergy client on the Linux box with another keyboard.</description></item></channel></rss>
