I gave it a try and I offered to write a review about the service.
DISCLAIMER: I don&amp;rsquo;t write many reviews on this blog, but I want to make sure a few things are clear. Vitalie was kind enough to set up an account for me to test with which would have normally cost me $9/month. However, he didn&amp;rsquo;t give me any compensation of any kind for the review itself and there was nothing done for me outside of what a customer would receive at a paid service level at Luadns.</description></item></channel></rss>
