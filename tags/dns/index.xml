They have issued over 1.4 million certificates since launch in the fall of 2015.
If you are not familiar with how Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt operates, here is an extremely simple explanation:
Create a private key Make a request for a new certificate Complete the challenge process You have a certificate! That is highly simplified, but there is plenty of detail available on how the whole system works.</description></item><item><title>cups.service start operation timed out in Fedora 22</title><link>https://major.io/2015/06/09/cups-service-start-operation-timed-out-in-fedora-22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 14:35:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/06/09/cups-service-start-operation-timed-out-in-fedora-22/</guid><description>Applications on my Fedora 22 system kept stalling when I attempted to print. My system journal was full of these log messages:

Spamassassin stopped doing DNS lookups for RBL and SPF checks.
I had one of these moments:
My logs looked like this:
plugin: eval failed: available_nameservers: No DNS servers available! plugin: eval failed: available_nameservers: No DNS servers available! rules: failed to run NO_DNS_FOR_FROM RBL test, skipping: (available_nameservers: [.</description></item><item><title>DNS Service Review: Luadns</title><link>https://major.io/2012/07/22/dns-service-review-luadns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2012 20:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/07/22/dns-service-review-luadns/</guid><description>Vitalie Cherpec contacted me back in May about his new hosted DNS offering, Luadns. I gave it a try and I offered to write a review about the service.
DISCLAIMER: I don&amp;rsquo;t write many reviews on this blog, but I want to make sure a few things are clear. Vitalie was kind enough to set up an account for me to test with which would have normally cost me $9/month. However, he didn&amp;rsquo;t give me any compensation of any kind for the review itself and there was nothing done for me outside of what a customer would receive at a paid service level at Luadns.</description></item><item><title>WordPress + W3 Total Cache + MaxCDN How-To</title><link>https://major.io/2010/02/13/wordpress-w3-total-cache-maxcdn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2010 03:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/02/13/wordpress-w3-total-cache-maxcdn/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of WordPress as a blog and CMS platform. While it does have its problems, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple to set up, it&amp;rsquo;s extensible, and - when properly configured - it has great performance. The WP Super Cache plugin has been a staple on my WordPress blogs for quite some time and it has solved almost all of my performance problems.
However, when you load up quite a few plugins or a heavy theme, the performance will dip due to the increased number of stylesheets, javascript files, and images.</description></item></channel></rss>
