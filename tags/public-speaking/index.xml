There were plenty of informative breakouts and some interesting keynotes.
Keynotes Beth Cohen shared some of the work that Verizon has done with software-defined WAN on customer-premises equipment (CPE). She showed a demo of how customers could easily provision virtual network hardware, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems, without waiting for hardware or cabling changes. I&amp;rsquo;m less familiar with the world of telcos, so I found this really interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
