Before that, I used shared hosting, VPS providers (&amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t a popular thing back then), and dedicated servers. Each had their drawbacks in different areas. Some didn&amp;rsquo;t perform well, some couldn&amp;rsquo;t recover from failure well, and some were terribly time consuming to maintain.
This post will explain why I decided to try colocation and will hopefully help you avoid some of my mistakes.</description></item></channel></rss>
