I needed a place to dump the huge amounts of information I was learning as an entry-level Linux support technician and I wanted to store everything in a place where it could be easily shared. The blog was born!
The blog now has over 700 posts on topics ranging from Linux system administration to job interview preparation. I&amp;rsquo;ll get an email or a tweet once every few weeks from someone saying: &amp;ldquo;I ran into a problem, Googled for it, and found your blog!</description></item><item><title>Woot! Eight years of my blog</title><link>https://major.io/2015/04/14/woot-eight-years-of-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 18:53:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/04/14/woot-eight-years-of-my-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>The spring of 2015 marks eight years of this blog! I&amp;rsquo;ve learned plenty of tough lessons along the way and I&amp;rsquo;ve made some changes recently that might be handy for other people. After watching &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sashalaund">Sasha Laundy&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> video from her awesome talk at Pycon 2015&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, I&amp;rsquo;m even more energized to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with other people. &lt;em>(Seriously: Go watch that video or review the slides whether you work in IT or not. It&amp;rsquo;s worth your time.)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

The update fixes two CVE&amp;rsquo;s and a few other security issues.
eWeek has an informative article with additional details on the update.</description></item><item><title>Five years of rackerhacker.com</title><link>https://major.io/2012/02/14/five-years-of-rackerhacker-com/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2012 14:45:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/02/14/five-years-of-rackerhacker-com/</guid><description>Today marks the fifth year that this blog has existed on the internet. I bought the domain on February 14th, 2007 and tossed together a quick WordPress installation (I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember the version now!) to hold my notes that I was gathering at work.
Rackspace as an entry-level Linux system administrator. The abrupt change from &amp;ldquo;top dog at the startup&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;wow, I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Linux&amp;rdquo; caught me by surprise and I was trying to stuff as much knowledge into my brain as quickly as I could.</description></item><item><title>One month with GlusterFS in production</title><link>https://major.io/2010/08/11/one-month-with-glusterfs-in-production/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2010 13:29:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/08/11/one-month-with-glusterfs-in-production/</guid><description>As many of you might have noticed from my previous GlusterFS blog post and my various tweets, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with GlusterFS in production for my personal hosting needs for just over a month. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been learning quite a bit from some of the folks in the #gluster channel on Freenode. On a few occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve even been able to help out with some configuration problems from other users.</description></item><item><title>WordPress + W3 Total Cache + MaxCDN How-To</title><link>https://major.io/2010/02/13/wordpress-w3-total-cache-maxcdn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2010 03:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/02/13/wordpress-w3-total-cache-maxcdn/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of WordPress as a blog and CMS platform. While it does have its problems, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple to set up, it&amp;rsquo;s extensible, and - when properly configured - it has great performance. The WP Super Cache plugin has been a staple on my WordPress blogs for quite some time and it has solved almost all of my performance problems.
However, when you load up quite a few plugins or a heavy theme, the performance will dip due to the increased number of stylesheets, javascript files, and images.</description></item><item><title>WordPress and PHP 5.3.x: update_comment_type_cache() expected to be a reference</title><link>https://major.io/2009/12/21/wordpress-and-php-5-3-x-update_comment_type_cache-expected-to-be-a-reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2009 14:02:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2009/12/21/wordpress-and-php-5-3-x-update_comment_type_cache-expected-to-be-a-reference/</guid><description>I upgraded a Fedora 11 instance to Fedora 12 and found the following error at the top of one of my WordPress blogs:
Parameter 1 to update_comment_type_cache() expected to be a reference, value given in wp-includes/plugin.php on line 166 The problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a plugin, actually. It was within my theme&amp;rsquo;s (R755-light) functions.php:

There are quite a few improvements, bug fixes and security features available in the new version.
The automatic upgrade via the admin interface actually worked just fine for me. Of course, I backed up my database and files first, just to be sure.</description></item><item><title>Upgraded to WordPress 2.8.6 with some theme changes</title><link>https://major.io/2009/11/16/upgraded-to-wordpress-2-8-6-with-some-theme-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2009 04:32:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2009/11/16/upgraded-to-wordpress-2-8-6-with-some-theme-changes/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded the blog to WordPress 2.8.6 after I read about the registered user exploits.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped the Adsimple theme I was using, and I&amp;rsquo;m now using a slightly modified Dojo theme. It&amp;rsquo;s a little easier on the eyes, but it&amp;rsquo;s still lightweight enough to be fast on mobile broadband connections.

Most of the plugins are only compatible with WordPress 2.7.x or earlier, so I was a little concerned about them working with WordPress 2.8.2.
Then I stumbled upon the WordPress documentation that shows you how to require SSL with no plugins at all.

The files were all put in place, but when I tried to load /wp-admin/upgrade.php, this error popped up:
I was perplexed at the error, so I restored from a backup and began upgrading manually. The manual upgrades have always worked well for me in the past, so I figured this would probably fix the problem.</description></item><item><title>Upgraded to WordPress 2.7</title><link>https://major.io/2008/12/25/upgraded-to-wordpress-27/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2008 03:45:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/12/25/upgraded-to-wordpress-27/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded the blog successfully to WordPress 2.7 (with a bit of frustration). When I attempted the upgrade, I received this error:
Call to undefined method wpdb::has_cap() in schema.php on line 22
Even though I followed the instructions on the WordPress site, and I disabled all of my plugins, the error kept appearing. The only parts of the site that remained unchanged after the upgrade were the wp-config.php page and the wp-content directory.</description></item><item><title>Upgraded to WordPress 2.6.5</title><link>https://major.io/2008/12/01/upgraded-to-wordpress-265/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2008 00:18:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/12/01/upgraded-to-wordpress-265/</guid><description>If you run a WordPress blog, and you haven&amp;rsquo;t upgraded to WordPress 2.6.5, you might want to make the move soon.

The old site was done in Dokuwiki, and I found that it didn&amp;rsquo;t scale too well. The new site uses WordPress, and the performance is already improving.
Another improvement to the site is that it is now hosted on Mosso. This should allow the site to handle a lot more traffic and be more redundant than the original configuration.</description></item><item><title>New look</title><link>https://major.io/2008/09/20/new-look/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2008 20:19:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/09/20/new-look/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to adjust the look of this blog to make it easier to read and faster to download. My old Mandigo theme was great, but it required each user to download about 200kb worth of content to see the blog. The new theme is about 30-40kb per download and it renders faster in all the browsers I&amp;rsquo;ve tested.

This blog runs on a server with dual Xeon Woodcrest CPU&amp;rsquo;s, 64-bit CentOS 4.5 and a 100mbit network connection. Here&amp;rsquo;s the first test with WP-Cache turned off:
