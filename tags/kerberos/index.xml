Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t really hate Kerberos. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an inside joke with my coworkers who are studying for some of the RHCA exams at Rackspace. The additional security provided by Kerberos is quite good but the setup involves a lot of small steps.</description></item><item><title>Kerberos for haters</title><link>https://major.io/2012/02/02/kerberos-for-haters/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2012 04:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/02/02/kerberos-for-haters/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first one to admit that Kerberos drives me a little insane. It&amp;rsquo;s a requirement for two of the exams in Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s RHCA certification track and I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to learn it. It provides some pretty nice security features for large server environments. You get central single sign ons, encrypted authentication, and bidirectional validation. However, getting it configured can be a real pain due to some rather archaic commands and shells.</description></item></channel></rss>
