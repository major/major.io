I ended up with a set of PowerEdge R710&amp;rsquo;s at work for a lab environment and the BIOS versions were different on each server.
Downloading the latest firmware Start by heading over to Dell&amp;rsquo;s support site and enter your system&amp;rsquo;s service tag. You can use lshw to find your service tag:

I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a Lenovo X1 Carbon (3rd gen) and that&amp;rsquo;s my preferred laptop. More on this change later.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good laptop to run Linux for a while now and my new Dell XPS 13 9343 has arrived. It was released at CES in 2015 and it received quite a lot of attention for packing a large amount of pixels into a very small laptop frame with excellent battery life.</description></item><item><title>Getting Dellâ€™s racadm working in Fedora 20</title><link>https://major.io/2014/06/20/getting-dells-racadm-working-in-fedora-20/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 14:39:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/06/20/getting-dells-racadm-working-in-fedora-20/</guid><description>Dell provides the racadm software on Linux that allows you to manage Dell hardware from a Linux system. Getting it installed on a very modern distribution like Fedora 20 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported, but here are some steps that might help you along the way:
First off, go to Dell&amp;rsquo;s site and review the racadm download instructions. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend following the Remote RACADM instructions so that you can manage multiple systems from your Fedora installation.</description></item></channel></rss>
