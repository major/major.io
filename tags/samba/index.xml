I have a QNAP NAS at home with a bunch of ISO&amp;rsquo;s stored in share available to guests and I wanted to use that with libvirt to boot new VM&amp;rsquo;s.

You still get access to many of the usual commands that you would normally find on a Linux box for emergencies.</description></item></channel></rss>
