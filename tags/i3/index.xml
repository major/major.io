I use plenty of gtk applications, such as Firefox and Evolution, and configuring them within i3 can be confusing.
This post covers a few methods to change configurations for GNOME and gtk applications from i3.
lxappearance Almost all of the gtk theming settings are available in lxappearance.

It automatically tiles windows and can manage those tiles across multiple virtual desktops.
However, there are certain applications that I really prefer in a floating window. Floating windows do not get tiled and they can easily be dragged around with your mouse. They&amp;rsquo;re the type of windows you expect to see on other non-tiling desktops such as GNOME or KDE.</description></item></channel></rss>
