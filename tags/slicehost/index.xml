A recent blog post from Mixpanel inspired me to write a quick how-to for Fedora users on using OpenVPN to talk to instances privately in the Rackspace Cloud.
The diagram at the right gives an idea of what this guide will allow you to accomplish. Consider a situation where you want to talk to the MySQL installation on db1 directly without requiring extra ssh tunnels or MySQL over SSL via the public network.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading Fedora 13 to Fedora 14 on Slicehost and Rackspace Cloud Servers</title><link>https://major.io/2010/11/03/upgrading-fedora-13-to-fedora-14-on-slicehost-and-rackspace-cloud-servers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2010 20:02:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/11/03/upgrading-fedora-13-to-fedora-14-on-slicehost-and-rackspace-cloud-servers/</guid><description>On most systems, using Fedora&amp;rsquo;s preupgrade package is the most reliable way to update to the next Fedora release. However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the case with Slicehost and Rackspace Cloud Servers.
Here are the steps for an upgrade from Fedora 13 to Fedora 14 via yum:
yum -y upgrade wget http://mirror.rackspace.com/fedora/releases/14/Fedora/x86_64/os/Packages/fedora-release-14-1.noarch.rpm rpm -Uvh fedora-release-14-1.noarch.rpm yum -y install yum yum -y upgrade If you happen to be upgrading a 32-bit instance on Slicehost, simply replace x86_64 with i386 in the url shown above.</description></item></channel></rss>
