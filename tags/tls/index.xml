This probably won&amp;rsquo;t have much of an effect on users who query icanhazip.com with automated tools, but it should deliver the content on this blog a little faster. If you&amp;rsquo;re using an older, non-HTTP/2 client - don&amp;rsquo;t worry. All of the sites will continue working for you as they always have.
Head on over to Wikipedia to learn more about HTTP/2 and its benefits.</description></item><item><title>Woot! Eight years of my blog</title><link>https://major.io/2015/04/14/woot-eight-years-of-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 18:53:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/04/14/woot-eight-years-of-my-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>The spring of 2015 marks eight years of this blog! I&amp;rsquo;ve learned plenty of tough lessons along the way and I&amp;rsquo;ve made some changes recently that might be handy for other people. After watching &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sashalaund">Sasha Laundy&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> video from her &lt;a href="http://blog.sashalaundy.com/talks/asking-helping/">awesome talk at Pycon 2015&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;m even more energized to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with other people. &lt;em>(Seriously: Go watch that video or review the slides whether you work in IT or not. It&amp;rsquo;s worth your time.)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the beginning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
