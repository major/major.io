It was a bug within Plesk&amp;rsquo;s AWStat&amp;rsquo;s implementation, and it was fixed in Plesk 8.3.
However, the fix only corrected the issue moving forward after the upgrade. There was no automated way to rebuild the previous months' statistics, even though the AWStats data was right there on the disk!</description></item></channel></rss>
