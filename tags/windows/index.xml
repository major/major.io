Attackers are getting smarter by delivering more 0-day exploits that fly under the radar of traditional A/V products and patches from the vendors are lagging behind. How can you attack the problem in the meantime?
Be smart and only enable Flash and Java for the sites you explicitly trust.</description></item><item><title>Highlight IP addresses with a double click in Firefox</title><link>https://major.io/2011/08/16/highlight-ip-addresses-with-a-double-click-in-firefox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 12:46:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/08/16/highlight-ip-addresses-with-a-double-click-in-firefox/</guid><description>My daily work involves working with a large number of servers and one of my frustrations with Firefox is that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to select an entire IP address with a double click with the default settings. Although it works right out of the box with Safari, you have to make a configuration adjustment in Firefox to get the same behavior.
To change the setting in Firefox, open up a new Firefox tab and go to about:config in the browser.</description></item></channel></rss>
