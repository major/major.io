Some examples include tildes (Ã±), accents (Ã¡), or other marks (Å¡). These marks are little hints that help you know how to pronounce a word properly (and they sometimes change the definition of a word entirely).
They are often skipped by non-native language speakers, and sometimes even by native speakers, but I have done my best to make a habit of including them when I can.</description></item></channel></rss>
