ERROR 1206 (HY000): The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size
MySQL is trying to tell you that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough room to store all of the row locks that it would need to execute your query. The only way to fix it for sure is to adjust innodb_buffer_pool_size and restart MySQL.</description></item><item><title>MySQL: The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size</title><link>https://major.io/2010/01/29/mysql-the-total-number-of-locks-exceeds-the-lock-table-size/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2010 13:12:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/01/29/mysql-the-total-number-of-locks-exceeds-the-lock-table-size/</guid><description>This problem has cropped up for me a few times, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always forgotten to make a post about it. If you&amp;rsquo;re working with a large InnoDB table and you&amp;rsquo;re updating, inserting, or deleting a large volume of rows, you may stumble upon this error:
InnoDB stores its lock tables in the main buffer pool. This means that the number of locks you can have at the same time is limited by the innodb_buffer_pool_size variable that was set when MySQL was started.</description></item></channel></rss>
