ERROR: Email delivery error Server replied: 127 Can't execute command '/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -t -fsomeuser@somedomain.com'. The error was appearing because safe_mode was enabled and SquirrelMail was unable to drop e-mails into /usr/sbin/squirrelmail. After disabling safe_mode on the server, the users were able to send e-mails via SquirrelMail.</description></item><item><title>Basic procmail configuration with spamassassin filtering</title><link>https://major.io/2008/08/13/basic-procmail-configuration-with-spamassassin-filtering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2008 17:00:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/08/13/basic-procmail-configuration-with-spamassassin-filtering/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used this extremely basic procmail configuration a million times, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great start for any server configuration. It passes e-mails through spamassassin (if they&amp;rsquo;re smaller than 256KB) and then filters any e-mail marked as spam to /dev/null:
LOGFILE=/var/log/procmail.log DROPPRIVS=yes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;:0fw | /usr/bin/spamc&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;:0 * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes /dev/null Of course, you can make this much more complicated with some additional customization.</description></item><item><title>sendmail: savemail panic</title><link>https://major.io/2008/02/18/sendmail-savemail-panic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2008 18:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/02/18/sendmail-savemail-panic/</guid><description>If you see a large mail queue and your system&amp;rsquo;s I/O is increasing, you may find messages like these in your syslog:
Losing q5/qfg9N5EwE3004499: savemail panic&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; SYSERR(root): savemail: cannot save rejected email anywhere
In this situation, there&amp;rsquo;s some reason why sendmail cannot deliver e-mail to the postmaster address. There&amp;rsquo;s a few issues that can create this problem:
Missing postmaster alias in /etc/aliases Hard disk is full The mail spool for the postmaster has the wrong ownership The mbox file for the postmaster is over 2GB and procmail can&amp;rsquo;t deliver the e-mail First, correct the situation that is preventing sendmail from delivering the e-mail to the postmaster user.</description></item></channel></rss>
