Recent product updates allow you to attach a Cloud Block Storage volume, and this opens up quite a few new possibilities for deployments.
So why not create a high-performance KVM hypervisor on an OnMetal server? Let&amp;rsquo;s do this.
Disclaimer WHOA THERE. These are amazing servers and because of that, they&amp;rsquo;re priced much differently than Cloud Servers are.</description></item><item><title>XenServer 6: Storage repository on software RAID</title><link>https://major.io/2012/01/16/xenserver-6-storage-repository-on-software-raid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 15:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/01/16/xenserver-6-storage-repository-on-software-raid/</guid><description>Although Citrix recommends against using software RAID with XenServer due to performance issues, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some pretty awful experiences with hardware RAID cards over the last few years. In addition, the price of software RAID makes it a very desirable solution.
Before you get started, go through the steps to disable GPT. That post also explains an optional adjustment to get a larger root partition (which I would recommend). You cannot complete the steps in this post if your XenServer installation uses GPT.</description></item><item><title>Live upgrade Fedora 15 to Fedora 16 using yum</title><link>https://major.io/2011/11/14/live-upgrading-fedora-15-to-fedora-16-using-yum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2011 04:37:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/11/14/live-upgrading-fedora-15-to-fedora-16-using-yum/</guid><description>Before we get started, I really ought to drop this here:
This begs the question: When should you use another method to upgrade Fedora? What other methods are there?
You have a few other methods to get the upgrade done:
Toss in a CD or DVD: You can upgrade via the anaconda installer provided on the CD, DVD or netinstall media. My experiences with this method for Fedora (as well as CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Red Hat) haven&amp;rsquo;t been too positive, but your results may vary.</description></item><item><title>HP Servers: hwraidinfo and hwraidstatus in Linux</title><link>https://major.io/2008/06/13/hp-servers-hwraidinfo-and-hwraidstatus-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2008 17:09:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/06/13/hp-servers-hwraidinfo-and-hwraidstatus-in-linux/</guid><description>Working with the RAID configurations on Linux can be a little involved if all you have is hpacucli. Luckily, the folks using HP&amp;rsquo;s OS distributions will get tools like hwraidinfo and hwraid status, but you can get these going in Linux as well.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a bash script equivalent of hwraidinfo which will work in Linux:
#!/bin/sh SLOTLIST=$(hpacucli ctrl all show | \ grep Slot | sed -e 's/^.*Slot //g' -e 's/ .</description></item></channel></rss>
