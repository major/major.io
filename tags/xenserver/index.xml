However, if you need to do this via configuration management or scripts, using a GUI isn&amp;rsquo;t an option.
Getting it done via the command line is relatively easy:
HOSTUUID=`xe host-list --minimal` SYSLOGHOST=syslog.example.com xe host-param-set uuid=${HOSTUUID} logging:syslog_destination=${SYSLOGHOST} xe host-syslog-reconfigure host-uuid=${HOSTUUID} Removing the configuration and going back to only local logging is easy as well:</description></item><item><title>Fedora 17 XVA ready to import into XenServer</title><link>https://major.io/2012/06/03/fedora-17-xva-ready-to-import-into-xenserver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 02:25:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/06/03/fedora-17-xva-ready-to-import-into-xenserver/</guid><description>After I wrote a post about my kickstart update for Fedora 17, I asked if anyone wanted a XVA export of a working Fedora 17 instance. Without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s the bzip2-compressed XVA file ready to be decompressed and imported into XenServer:
F17.xva.bz2 (221MB) The kickstart used to generate the XVA can be found on GitHub. To import this virtual machine export, use XenCenter or ssh to your XenServer instance and run:</description></item><item><title>Fedora 17 released, XenServer kickstarts updated</title><link>https://major.io/2012/05/30/fedora-17-released-xenserver-kickstarts-updated/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 20:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/05/30/fedora-17-released-xenserver-kickstarts-updated/</guid><description>Fedora 17 was released yesterday and you can download it now!
In addition, I made some edits to my kickstarts repository on GitHub to match up with the final release of Fedora 17. The kickstart took less than ten minutes to complete even with a remote repository configured for RPM packages.
Fedora &amp;amp; XenServer users: Would posting an actual XVA file for download make it easier for you to get started?</description></item><item><title>Fedora 17 is a go!</title><link>https://major.io/2012/05/25/fedora-17-is-a-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2012 12:54:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/05/25/fedora-17-is-a-go/</guid><description>I was glad to see the Fedora 17 Final is declared GOLD! announcement on the Fedora devel-announce list. If all goes well, we should see the formal release on May 29.
As some of you might have noticed, I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Xen. If you want to get Fedora 17 rolling in XenServer right now, just try my minimal kickstart. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to get a XVA/OVF-formatted image online in the next few days so you can hit the ground running if you&amp;rsquo;re in a hurry.</description></item><item><title>Installing XenServer 6.0.2 on an AOpen MP57</title><link>https://major.io/2012/03/12/installing-xenserver-6-0-2-on-an-aopen-mp57/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/03/12/installing-xenserver-6-0-2-on-an-aopen-mp57/</guid><description>Getting XenServer installed on some unusual platforms takes a bit of work and the AOpen MP57 is a challenging platform for a XenServer 6.0.2 installation.
My MP57 box came with the i57QMx-vP motherboard. If yours came with something else, this post may or may not work for you.
You&amp;rsquo;ll need the XenServer 6 installation ISO burned to a CD to get started. Boot the CD in your MP57 and wait for the initial boot screen to appear.</description></item><item><title>Installing Fedora 16 in XenServer</title><link>https://major.io/2012/02/11/installing-fedora-16-in-xenserver/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 03:39:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/02/11/installing-fedora-16-in-xenserver/</guid><description>Getting Fedora 16 working in XenServer isn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest thing to do, but I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a repository on GitHub that should help. The repository contains a kickstart file along with some brief instructions to help with the installation. If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to get started right now, just clone the repository:
git clone git://github.com/rackerhacker/kickstarts.git kickstarts There are some big issues with Fedora 16 which cause problems for installations within XenServer:</description></item><item><title>XenServer 6: Storage repository on software RAID</title><link>https://major.io/2012/01/16/xenserver-6-storage-repository-on-software-raid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 15:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/01/16/xenserver-6-storage-repository-on-software-raid/</guid><description>Although Citrix recommends against using software RAID with XenServer due to performance issues, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some pretty awful experiences with hardware RAID cards over the last few years. In addition, the price of software RAID makes it a very desirable solution.
Before you get started, go through the steps to disable GPT. That post also explains an optional adjustment to get a larger root partition (which I would recommend). You cannot complete the steps in this post if your XenServer installation uses GPT.</description></item><item><title>XenServer 6: Disable GPT and get a larger root partition</title><link>https://major.io/2012/01/13/xenserver-6-disable-gpt-and-get-a-larger-root-partition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2012 15:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/01/13/xenserver-6-disable-gpt-and-get-a-larger-root-partition/</guid><description>XenServer 6 is a solid virtualization platform, but the installer doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you many options for customized configurations. By default, it installs with a 4GB root partition and uses GUID Partition Tables (GPT). GPT is new in XenServer 6.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather use MBR partition tables and get a larger root partition. If you want to make these adjustments in your XenServer 6 installation, follow these steps after booting into the XenServer 6 install disc:</description></item></channel></rss>
