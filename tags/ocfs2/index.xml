These instructions should be somewhat close to what you would use on CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. However, CentOS and Red Hat don&amp;rsquo;t provide some of the packages needed, so you will need to use other software repositories like RPMFusion or EPEL.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using two Fedora 14 instances in the Rackspace Cloud with separate public and private networks.</description></item><item><title>Switching from GlusterFS to DRBD and OCFS2</title><link>https://major.io/2010/11/10/switching-from-glusterfs-to-drbd-and-ocfs2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2010 13:55:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/11/10/switching-from-glusterfs-to-drbd-and-ocfs2/</guid><description>As my uptime reports have shown, and as some of you have reported, my blog&amp;rsquo;s load time has increased steadily over the past few weeks. It turns out that one of my VM&amp;rsquo;s was on a physical machine that had some trouble and I was reaching a point where GlusterFS&amp;rsquo;s replicate functionality couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet my performance needs.
Instead of using GlusterFS as I had before in my redundant cloud hosting guide, I decided to use DRBD in dual-primary mode with OCFS2 as the clustering filesystem on top of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
