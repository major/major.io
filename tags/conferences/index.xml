The 2019 Texas Linux Fest was held in Irving at the Irving Convention Center. It was a great venue surrounded by lots of shops and restaurants.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t attended one of these events before, you really should! Attendees have varying levels of experience with Linux and the conference organizers (volunteers) work really hard to ensure everyone feels included.
The event usually falls on a Friday and Saturday.</description></item><item><title>How to thrive at a technical conference</title><link>https://major.io/2018/05/09/how-to-thrive-at-a-tech-conference/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 23:54:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2018/05/09/how-to-thrive-at-a-tech-conference/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the 2018 Red Hat Summit this week in San Francisco and I am enjoying the interactions between developers, executives, vendors, and engineers. It&amp;rsquo;s my seventh Summit (but my first as a Red Hat employee!), but I regularly meet people who are attending their first technical conference.
The question inevitably comes up: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so tired. How do you survive these events?&amp;rdquo;
One attendee asked me to write a blog post on my tips and tricks.</description></item></channel></rss>
