When you ask nova to build an instance, or a group of instances, nova&amp;rsquo;s scheduler system determines which hypervisors should run each instance. The scheduler uses filters to figure out where each instance belongs.
However, there are situations where the scheduler might put more than one of your instances on the same host, especially when resources are constrained.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner v1.3.0</title><link>https://major.io/2014/02/21/mysqltuner-v1-3-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2014 02:30:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/02/21/mysqltuner-v1-3-0/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been three long years since the last MySQLTuner release but you&amp;rsquo;ll now find version 1.3.0 available on GitHub.

The morning started off with three keynotes from HP, Intel, and Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s CTO, Brian Stevens.
HP&amp;rsquo;s message centered around converged cloud and that customers don&amp;rsquo;t need an all or nothing solution. They can pull the best pieces from every type of hosting to do what&amp;rsquo;s best for their business. The presentation from Intel was extremely heavy on the marketing side and didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to do with Red Hat.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner mentioned at the O‚ÄôReilly MySQL Conference</title><link>https://major.io/2011/04/15/mysqltuner-mentioned-at-the-oreilly-mysql-conference/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2011 01:56:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/04/15/mysqltuner-mentioned-at-the-oreilly-mysql-conference/</guid><description>If you push play, the video should scoot out to about the 14m40s mark where MySQLTuner appears on one of the slides.

You can&amp;rsquo;t get a much more concise definition of what pv does than this one:
pv allows a user to see the progress of data through a pipeline, by giving information such as time elapsed, percentage completed (with progress bar), current throughput rate, total data transferred, and ETA.
The usage certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated:</description></item><item><title>MySQL: The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size</title><link>https://major.io/2010/02/16/mysql-the-total-number-of-locks-exceeds-the-lock-table-size-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2010 18:00:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/02/16/mysql-the-total-number-of-locks-exceeds-the-lock-table-size-2/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re running an operation on a large number of rows within a table that uses the InnoDB storage engine, you might see this error:
ERROR 1206 (HY000): The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size
MySQL is trying to tell you that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough room to store all of the row locks that it would need to execute your query.

If you&amp;rsquo;re working with a large InnoDB table and you&amp;rsquo;re updating, inserting, or deleting a large volume of rows, you may stumble upon this error:
InnoDB stores its lock tables in the main buffer pool. This means that the number of locks you can have at the same time is limited by the innodb_buffer_pool_size variable that was set when MySQL was started.</description></item><item><title>Ugly upgrade path from WordPress 2.7.1 to 2.8</title><link>https://major.io/2009/06/13/ugly-upgrade-path-from-wordpress-2-7-1-to-2-8/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2009 17:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2009/06/13/ugly-upgrade-path-from-wordpress-2-7-1-to-2-8/</guid><description>When I tried to do an automatic upgrade from WordPress 2.7.1 to 2.8 yesterday, it failed miserably.

MySQLTuner now checks for fragmented tables
When deletes or updates are made on tables, MySQL will often leave holes behind that it hopes to fill in later. If the size and quantity keep climbing, the holes can cause performance degradation for writes and reads. Fragmentation can be corrected with OPTIMIZE TABLE, and the script recommends it if needed.</description></item><item><title>MySQLTuner is the Debian Package of the Day!</title><link>https://major.io/2008/05/28/mysqltuner-is-the-debian-package-of-the-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2008 02:23:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/05/28/mysqltuner-is-the-debian-package-of-the-day/</guid><description>I just received a Google Alert about MySQLTuner being the Debian Package of the Day!</description></item><item><title>After Plesk upgrade, ‚ÄúCannot initialize InnoDB‚Äù</title><link>https://major.io/2008/05/01/after-plesk-upgrade-cannot-initialize-innodb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 17:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/05/01/after-plesk-upgrade-cannot-initialize-innodb/</guid><description>Upgrading Plesk from 7.5.x to 8.x will change your Plesk-related MySQL tables from MyISAM to InnoDB.

Why do I like this book so much?
Teaching by application - The book teaches fundamentals by showing how to apply techniques to an active website. There&amp;rsquo;s not a ton of theory to wade through, and you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re learning the material faster.</description></item><item><title>Reducing locking delays in MySQL</title><link>https://major.io/2008/04/16/reducing-locking-delays-in-mysql/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2008 17:32:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/04/16/reducing-locking-delays-in-mysql/</guid><description>Before getting started, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why MySQL uses locks. In short - MySQL uses locks to prevent multiple clients from corrupting data due to simultaneous writes while also protecting clients from reading partially-written data.
Some of you may be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Okay, this makes sense.&amp;rdquo; If that&amp;rsquo;s you, skip the next two paragraphs. If not, keep reading.
Analogies can help understand topics like these.

I&amp;rsquo;ve received reports that MySQLTuner will stall while enumerating tables on servers that contain a lot of tables or a lot of large tables. You can now use the --skipsize option to skip over the table enumeration process and let the script finish. However, you will not be able to receive some recommendations since the script was unable to determine which storage engines are enabled.</description></item><item><title>Importing MySQL dumps made on 64-bit servers</title><link>https://major.io/2008/03/21/importing-mysql-dumps-made-on-64-bit-servers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2008 17:51:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/03/21/importing-mysql-dumps-made-on-64-bit-servers/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s tough to find examples of dumps that can&amp;rsquo;t be properly reimported on other servers.
