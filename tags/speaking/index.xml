Luckily, the events were separated only by a five minute walk. Many of the slides from the OpenPOWER Summit are already available online.
One of my favorite talks was from Prof. Mateo Valero, the director of the Barcelona Supercomputer Center (Centro Nacional de Supercomputación). He was a great speaker and he talked a lot about how OpenPOWER has given them a new edge.</description></item></channel></rss>
