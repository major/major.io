We&amp;rsquo;ve all had one of those moments: your speakers are turned up and you browse to a website with an annoying advertisement that plays immediately.
This feature stopped working for me somewhere in the Firefox 65 beta releases. Also, the usual setting in the preference page (under Privacy &amp;amp; Security) seems to be missing.</description></item><item><title>Highlight IP addresses with a double click in Firefox</title><link>https://major.io/2011/08/16/highlight-ip-addresses-with-a-double-click-in-firefox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 12:46:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/08/16/highlight-ip-addresses-with-a-double-click-in-firefox/</guid><description>My daily work involves working with a large number of servers and one of my frustrations with Firefox is that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to select an entire IP address with a double click with the default settings. Although it works right out of the box with Safari, you have to make a configuration adjustment in Firefox to get the same behavior.
To change the setting in Firefox, open up a new Firefox tab and go to about:config in the browser.</description></item></channel></rss>
