When I connected to my wireless network via NetworkManager, I entered my WPA2 passphrase, and then I was prompted to enter a password for gnome-keyring. I went back to the couch, SSH&amp;rsquo;ed in, and continued configuring it remotely. When it rebooted, it never came back online.
Once I switched the TV back over to the Mini, I saw that gnome-keyring had popped up and it was asking for my password.</description></item></channel></rss>
