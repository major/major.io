However, there are those times when you need a customized image to support a certain configuration or to speed up CI processes.
You can get a customized image via a few methods:
Build from an existing AMI, customize it, and snapshot it. Use an automated tool, such as Packer, to automate #1. Build your own image locally in KVM, VMware, or Virtualbox and upload the image into S3, import it into an EC2, and create an AMI from the snapshot.</description></item></channel></rss>
