The server wasn&amp;rsquo;t under much load, but a quick run of dmesg threw quite a bit of these lines out onto the screen:
EXT3-fs warning (device sda5): ext3_dx_add_entry: Directory index full!
After a thorough amount of searching, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find out what the error actually meant.</description></item></channel></rss>
