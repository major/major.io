It does what I need it to, but it&amp;rsquo;s often hard to get it rolling when it needs to do something for me. When I run it, I run it in batch mode, which requires me to have a .nessusrc file. However, there is almost no documentation on how to create one of these files.</description></item></channel></rss>
