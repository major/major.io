One of the more annoying items that I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with for quite some time is how to boot up with the wireless LAN and Bluetooth disabled by default.

For example, if I shut down with wifi off and Bluetooth on, the laptop would boot up later with wifi off and Bluetooth on.</description></item><item><title>Getting online with a CradlePoint PHS-300 and an AT&amp;T USBConnect Mercury</title><link>https://major.io/2011/12/16/getting-online-with-a-cradlepoint-phs-300-and-an-att-usbconnect-mercury/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2011 07:07:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2011/12/16/getting-online-with-a-cradlepoint-phs-300-and-an-att-usbconnect-mercury/</guid><description>Anyone who has used a 3G ExpressCard or USB stick knows how handy they can be when you need internet access away from home (and away from Wi-Fi).

That led me to pick up a CradlePoint PHS-300 (discontinued by the manufacturer, but available from Amazon for about $35).</description></item></channel></rss>
