This was my first trip to any DevConf and it was my second trip to Brno.
Lots of snow showed up on the second day and more snow arrived later in the week!
First talk of 2019 I co-presented a talk with one of my teammates, Nikolai, about some of the fun work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing at Red Hat to improve the quality of the Linux kernel in an automated way.</description></item><item><title>Getting ready for IBM Edge 2016</title><link>https://major.io/2016/09/14/getting-ready-for-ibm-edge-2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/09/14/getting-ready-for-ibm-edge-2016/</guid><description>IBM Edge 2016 starts next week in Las Vegas with an emphasis on changing how we think about technology. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be interested in the sessions on open source technology and advances in OpenPOWER.
Here are a few of the sessions from my must-see list:

My goal is to inform more people about what we&amp;rsquo;re doing in the OpenStack-Ansible community and bring on more contributors to the project.
July brought lots of changes for the OpenStack-Ansible project and the remaining work for the Newton release is coming together well. Many of the changes made in the Newton branch have made deployments faster, more reliable and more repeatable.</description></item><item><title>Whatâ€™s Happening in OpenStack-Ansible (WHOA) â€“ June 2016</title><link>https://major.io/2016/06/15/whats-happening-openstack-ansible-whoa-june-2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 19:58:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/06/15/whats-happening-openstack-ansible-whoa-june-2016/</guid><description>The world of OpenStack moves quickly. Each day brings new features, new bug fixes, and new ways of thinking. The OpenStack-Ansible community strives to understand these changes and make them easier for operators to implement.
The OpenStack-Ansible project is a collection of playbooks and roles written by operators for operators. These playbooks make it easier to deploy, maintain, and upgrade an OpenStack cloud.
Keeping up with the changes in the OpenStack-Ansible project is challenging.</description></item><item><title>Fight SOPA &amp; PIPA</title><link>https://major.io/2012/01/12/fight-sopa-and-pipa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2012 13:36:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/01/12/fight-sopa-and-pipa/</guid><description>Get informed about what the US government is trying to accomplish with SOPA and PIPA.
