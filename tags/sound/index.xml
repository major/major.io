The Fedora installation was easy, but I noticed a variety of &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; or clicking sounds when audio played, especially terminal bells.
If everything was quiet and I triggered a terminal bell, I would hear a loud pop just before the terminal bell sound. However, if I played music and then triggered a terminal bell, the pop was gone.</description></item></channel></rss>
