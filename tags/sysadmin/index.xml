They have amazing ideas and they don&amp;rsquo;t place any limits on themselves. In particular, their curiosity is limitless.
A great question I joined several other local employers at the University of Texas at San Antonio last week for mock interviews with computer science students. We went through plenty of sample questions and gave feedback to the students on their content and delivery during the mock interviews.</description></item><item><title>Helpful, low-FUD information security sites, mailing lists, and blogs</title><link>https://major.io/2015/01/08/helpful-low-fud-information-security-sites-mailing-lists-blogs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 13:55:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/01/08/helpful-low-fud-information-security-sites-mailing-lists-blogs/</guid><description>Keeping current with the latest trends and technologies in the realm of information security is critical and there are many options to choose from. However, as with any content on the internet, it takes some effort to find sites with a good signal-to-noise ratio.

It can write down historical records about your server at regular intervals. This can help you diagnose CPU usage, RAM usage, or network usage problems. In addition, sysstat also provides some handy command line utilities like vmstat, iostat, and pidstat that give you a live view of what your system is doing.
On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), you install the sysstat package and enable it with a quick edit to /etc/default/sysstat and the cron job takes it from there.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in live booting Linux distributions</title><link>https://major.io/2014/07/29/adventures-in-live-booting-linux-distributions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2014 13:05:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/07/29/adventures-in-live-booting-linux-distributions/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with live booting Linux distributions. Almost every Linux distribution under the sun has a method for making live CD&amp;rsquo;s, writing live USB sticks, or booting live images over the network. The primary use case for some distributions is on a live medium (like KNOPPIX).
However, I embarked on an adventure to look at live booting Linux for a different use case. Sure, many live environments are used for demonstrations or installations - temporary activities for a desktop or a laptop.</description></item><item><title>Configure remote syslog for XenServer via the command line</title><link>https://major.io/2014/06/03/configure-remote-syslog-for-xenserver-via-the-command-line/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 17:55:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/06/03/configure-remote-syslog-for-xenserver-via-the-command-line/</guid><description>Citrix has some helpful documentation online about configuring remote syslog support for XenServer using the XenCenter GUI. However, if you need to do this via configuration management or scripts, using a GUI isn&amp;rsquo;t an option.
Getting it done via the command line is relatively easy:
HOSTUUID=`xe host-list --minimal` SYSLOGHOST=syslog.example.com xe host-param-set uuid=${HOSTUUID} logging:syslog_destination=${SYSLOGHOST} xe host-syslog-reconfigure host-uuid=${HOSTUUID} Removing the configuration and going back to only local logging is easy as well:</description></item><item><title>Switching to systemd on Debian jessie</title><link>https://major.io/2014/05/20/switching-to-systemd-on-debian-jessie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2014 13:47:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/05/20/switching-to-systemd-on-debian-jessie/</guid><description>It seems like everyone is embracing systemd these days. It&amp;rsquo;s been in Fedora since 2011 and it&amp;rsquo;s already in the RHEL 7 release candidate. Arch Linux and Gentoo have it as well. Debian got on board with the jessie release (which is currently in testing).
Switching from old SysVinit to systemd in Debian jessie is quite simple. For the extremely cautious system administrators, you can follow Debian&amp;rsquo;s guide and test systemd before you make the full cutover.</description></item><item><title>Helpful Linux I/O stack diagram</title><link>https://major.io/2014/04/30/helpful-linux-io-stack-diagram/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:03:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2014/04/30/helpful-linux-io-stack-diagram/</guid><description>During one of my regular trips to reddit, I stumbled upon an amazingly helpful Linux I/O stack diagram:
