However, the documentation on systemd-networkd with bonding is a bit lacking (but I have a pull request pending for that).
Rackspace&amp;rsquo;s OnMetal Servers are a good place to test since they have bonded networks configured by default. They&amp;rsquo;re also quite fast and always fun for experiments.
To get started, head on over to the Rackspace Cloud control panel and build a compute-1 OnMetal server and choose Fedora 22 as your operating system.</description></item><item><title>Boot the Xen hypervisor by default in Fedora 17 with GRUB 2</title><link>https://major.io/2012/07/16/boot-the-xen-hypervisor-by-default-in-fedora-17-with-grub-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2012 15:00:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2012/07/16/boot-the-xen-hypervisor-by-default-in-fedora-17-with-grub-2/</guid><description>Although GRUB 2 does give us some nice benefits, changing its configuration can be a bit of a challenge if you&amp;rsquo;re used to working with the original GRUB for many, many years. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently installed some Fedora 17 systems with Xen and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go back to the documentation to change the default GRUB 2 boot option. Hopefully this post will save you some time.
A good place to start reading is on Fedora&amp;rsquo;s own page about GRUB 2 and the helpful commands provided to manage its configuration.</description></item></channel></rss>
