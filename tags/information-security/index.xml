This release is Version 1, Release 3, and it contains four main changes:
V-77819 - Multifactor authentication is required for graphical logins V-77821 - Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) kernel module must be disabled V-77823 - Single user mode must require user authentication V-77825 - Address space layout randomization (ASLR) must be enabled Deep dive Let&amp;rsquo;s break down this list to understand what each one means.</description></item><item><title>Old role, new name: ansible-hardening</title><link>https://major.io/2017/06/27/old-role-new-name-ansible-hardening/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:49:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2017/06/27/old-role-new-name-ansible-hardening/</guid><description>The interest in the openstack-ansible-security role has taken off faster than I expected, and one piece of constant feedback I received was around the name of the role. Some users were unsure if they needed to use the role in an OpenStack cloud or if the OpenStack-Ansible project was required.
The role works everywhere - OpenStack cloud or not. I started a mailing list thread on the topic and we eventually settled on a new name: ansible-hardening!</description></item><item><title>augenrules fails with ‚Äúrule exists‚Äù when loading rules into auditd</title><link>https://major.io/2017/01/03/augenrules-fails-with-rule-exists-when-loading-rules-into-auditd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 19:01:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2017/01/03/augenrules-fails-with-rule-exists-when-loading-rules-into-auditd/</guid><description>When I came back from the holiday break, I found that the openstack-ansible-security role wasn&amp;rsquo;t passing tests any longer. The Ansible playbook stopped when augenrules ran to load the new audit rules. The error wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly helpful:
/usr/sbin/augenrules: No change Error sending add rule data request (Rule exists) There was an error in line 5 of /etc/audit/audit.rules A duplicated rule? I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lots of changes to implement the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) and I assumed I put in the same rule twice with an errant copy and paste.</description></item><item><title>Why should students learn to write code?</title><link>https://major.io/2016/10/10/why-should-students-learn-to-write-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2016 04:08:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2016/10/10/why-should-students-learn-to-write-code/</guid><description>There are lots of efforts underway to get students (young and old) to learn to write code. There are far-reaching efforts, like the Hour of Code, and plenty of smaller, more focused projects, such as the Design and Technology Academy (part of Northeast ISD here in San Antonio, Texas). These are excellent programs that enrich the education of many students.
I often hear a question from various people about these programs:</description></item><item><title>Talking to college students about information security</title><link>https://major.io/2015/11/10/talking-to-college-students-about-information-security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 14:50:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/11/10/talking-to-college-students-about-information-security/</guid><description>I was recently asked to talk to Computer Information Systems students at the University of the Incarnate Word here in San Antonio about information security in the business world. The students are learning plenty of the technical parts of information security and the complexity that comes from dealing with complicated computer networks. As we all know, it&amp;rsquo;s the non-technical things that are often the most important in those tough situations.</description></item><item><title>Research Paper: Securing Linux Containers</title><link>https://major.io/2015/08/14/research-paper-securing-linux-containers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 20:45:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2015/08/14/research-paper-securing-linux-containers/</guid><description>It seems like there&amp;rsquo;s a new way to run containers every week. The advantages and drawbacks of each approach are argued about on mailing lists, in IRC channels, and in person, around the world. However, the largest amount of confusion seems to be around security.
Launching secure containers I&amp;rsquo;ve written about launching secure containers on this blog many times before:
