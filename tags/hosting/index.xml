Before that, I used shared hosting, VPS providers (&amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t a popular thing back then), and dedicated servers. Each had their drawbacks in different areas.

This post will explain why I decided to try colocation and will hopefully help you avoid some of my mistakes.</description></item><item><title>A nerdâ€™s perspective on cloud hosting</title><link>https://major.io/2010/08/25/a-nerds-perspective-on-cloud-hosting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2010 13:03:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2010/08/25/a-nerds-perspective-on-cloud-hosting/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s go ahead and get this out of the way: The following post contains only my personal opinions.

The term &amp;ldquo;cloud hosting&amp;rdquo; has become more popular over the past few years and it seems like everyone is talking about it. I&amp;rsquo;m often asked by customers and coworkers about what cloud hosting really is. Where does traditional dedicated hosting end and cloud begin?</description></item></channel></rss>
