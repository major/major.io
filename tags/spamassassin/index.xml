Spamassassin stopped doing DNS lookups for RBL and SPF checks.
I had one of these moments:
My logs looked like this:
plugin: eval failed: available_nameservers: No DNS servers available! plugin: eval failed: available_nameservers: No DNS servers available! rules: failed to run NO_DNS_FOR_FROM RBL test, skipping: (available_nameservers: [.</description></item><item><title>Basic procmail configuration with spamassassin filtering</title><link>https://major.io/2008/08/13/basic-procmail-configuration-with-spamassassin-filtering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2008 17:00:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://major.io/2008/08/13/basic-procmail-configuration-with-spamassassin-filtering/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used this extremely basic procmail configuration a million times, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great start for any server configuration. It passes e-mails through spamassassin (if they&amp;rsquo;re smaller than 256KB) and then filters any e-mail marked as spam to /dev/null:

When it runs, it uses a ton of CPU time and causes a lot of disk I/O as well. When running top, you may see multiple spamd processes. For a high-volume e-mail server (like the one I administer), this is simply unacceptable.
I decided to do something about it, and here are the steps:</description></item></channel></rss>
