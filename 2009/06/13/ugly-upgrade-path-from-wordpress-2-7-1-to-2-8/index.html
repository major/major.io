<content><p>When I tried to do an automatic upgrade from WordPress 2.7.1 to 2.8 yesterday, it failed miserably. The files were all put in place, but when I tried to load <code>/wp-admin/upgrade.php</code>, this error popped up:</p><p>I was perplexed at the error, so I restored from a backup and began <a href=http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress>upgrading manually</a>. The manual upgrades have always worked well for me in the past, so I figured this would probably fix the problem. After the upgrade, I went to <code>/wp-admin/upgrade.php</code> and saw:</p><p><strong>What the heck is going on?</strong> I restored from a backup, tried the manual upgrade again, and it still failed. I took a look at the lines causing the problem in <code>schema.php</code>:</p><p>I figured I could comment out the if statement and probably still be safe:</p><p><strong>Success?</strong> I could make it through the <code>upgrade.php</code> part fine at this point, but whenever I tried to add a tag to a post, it wasn&rsquo;t saving to the database. I caught this error in my apache logs:</p><p><code>[Fri Jun 12 23:45:03 2009] [error] [client 72.183.200.144] WordPress database error Duplicate entry 'debian' for key 'slug' for query INSERT INTO wp_terms (`name`,`slug`,`term_group`) VALUES ('debian','debian','0') made by wp_insert_term, referer: http://rackerhacker.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=877</code></p><p><strong>Frustration quickly ensued.</strong> I moved my <code>/wp-content/</code> folder out of the way and replaced it with the standard WordPress stuff, but that didn&rsquo;t help. I moved plugins out of the way, one by one, but that didn&rsquo;t fix it either. Then I spotted a strange file sitting in <code>/wp-content/</code> called <code>db.php</code>. When I opened it, I found a <a href=http://pastie.org/private/rmbmk3ohgmdbujotnrg>lot of database setup classes for mysqli</a>.</p><p>I renamed it to <code>db.pleasedonteverrunthisphp</code> and I was able to save tags properly. So far, I haven&rsquo;t found any issues after I made chat change.</p><p>Does anyone know where that file might have come from? I don&rsquo;t remember adding it myself, so I&rsquo;m wondering if it was ever packaged with a WordPress plugin or a WordPress installation. I hope this helps someone else!</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/database/>#database</a>
