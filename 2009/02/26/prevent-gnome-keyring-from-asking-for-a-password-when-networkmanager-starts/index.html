<content><p>I recently tossed Ubuntu 8.10 on my Mac Mini at home to use it as a home theater PC (with <a href=http://boxee.tv/>Boxee</a>). When I connected to my wireless network via NetworkManager, I entered my WPA2 passphrase, and then I was prompted to enter a password for gnome-keyring. I went back to the couch, SSH&rsquo;ed in, and continued configuring it remotely. When it rebooted, it never came back online.</p><p>Once I switched the TV back over to the Mini, I saw that gnome-keyring had popped up and it was asking for my password. I entered it, and the Mini joined the wireless network. Each time I rebooted, I had to go through this procedure (which is annoying to do with a HTPC that is across the room). I found a <a href=http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/07/12/automatically-unlocking-the-default-gnome-keyring-pam-keyring/>pretty fancy solution</a>, but it looked a little complicated for my setup.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how I did it in a simpler way in Ubuntu 8.10:</p><ul><li>Click <strong>Applications</strong> > <strong>Accessories</strong> > <strong>Passwords and Encryption Keys</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> > <strong>Preferences</strong></li><li>Click your keyring name (usually <em>default</em>)</li><li>Click <strong>Change Unlock Password</strong></li><li>Enter your current password in the top box, but leave the bottom two boxes blank</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Use unsafe storage</strong> when you are prompted</li><li>Click <strong>Close</strong></li></ul><p>If you reboot your machine, it should not ask for a password for your keyring any longer. This allowed my system to log into my wireless network automatically.</p><p><strong>WHOA THERE:</strong> Since the only password being stored on the device is my WPA2 password, I&rsquo;m not concerned about the security of the keyring. If you&rsquo;re doing this on a laptop or desktop that other people use, I would highly recommend not following these steps. All of your passwords and keys will be stored unencrypted.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/annoyances/>#annoyances</a>
