Is reading a man page more your style? [Look no further.][1]

**Who is behind this blog? Why do you do it?**

My name is Major Hayden, and yes, Major is my first name. I have been a
Linux system administrator for a long time, and along the way, there have
been many influential people who have taught me best practices, problem
solving skills, and patience. I feel that this blog is a way to give back to
those who have helped me, and to those who are still learning.

**What is your background in technology?**

Technology has always been something which captivates me. When I was very
young, my parents bought a Tandy 386SX and within a few months, I knew more
about it than they did. Many years later, I began designing websites and
writing HTML without knowing what was going on behind the scenes.

A good friend came to me and asked me if I'd ever tried Gentoo. I
scoffed at Gentoo and went back to my point-and-click Mandriva installation.
He was persistent, and we spent all night installing Gentoo on an old machine
(if you've never used Gentoo, you won't understand why it took
all night). After that, I was hooked. I've been managing Linux and
Windows environments in small and large configurations since 2002.

I've also worked at an SSL Certificate Authority, worked on ambulances, and sacked groceries.

**What are you doing now?**

I'll leave that to [LinkedIn][2].

If there's anything else you want to know, or if you have comments, [I'm all ears][1].
