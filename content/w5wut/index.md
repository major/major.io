I'm an amateur radio operator licensed in the United States under the callsign [W5WUT]
_(formerly KG5VYL)_. The radio bug bit me back in 2017 after attending the [Overland
Expo] in North Carolina.

Our society depends on communication to survive. Amateur radio fills critical gaps
during emergencies and it's a great hobby to learn more about radios, electronics,
computers, and just communication in general.

There's a [ham radio FAQ] on the blog already that I need to update. ðŸ˜‰

## Equipment

Almost every conversation with a radio operator turns to _"what equipment do you use?"_:

* Mobile
  * Kenwood TM-D710GA
  * Comet SBB-1 and SBB-5
* Home
  * Icom IC-746 (2m + HF)
  * Icom IC-7300 (HF)
  * Comet GP-3 2m/70cm
  * RigExpert AA-55 ZOOM
* Portable
  * Buddipole
  * 6m dipole
  * 20m EFHW
* Handheld
  * Kenwood KH-20A
  * Yaesu VX-8

## Find me on the air

I enjoy SSB and FT8 on 20m on the weekends, but during the week, you can find me on
146.520 in the San Antonio area. I hop on the KE5HBB repeater in Live Oak, TX as well.
