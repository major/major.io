# Welcome!

***This page is a work in progress!***

The world of amateur, or ham, radio is huge and it's what you want to make of
it. The itch struck me in the middle of 2017 and I learned a lot since then.

People often ask me questions about all kinds of amateur radio topics and I
decided to compile all of the answers into a big page that I can update over
time. If your questions isn't answered here, please [send me an
email](mailto:w5wut@arrl.net) and I'll get it answered!

Keep in mind that the vast majority of the topics presented here will be
applicable to amateur radio all over the world, but much of the discussion
around licensing and rules is very specific to the United States.

As with anything else, everyone has their own opinions about what makes a
hobby special. As long as **you** enjoy your time working with a hobby, it
does not matter what anyone else says, so long as you avoid getting in the way
of their enjoyment. *(More on that later.)*

# The very very basics {#basics}

This section covers the absolute basic questions around the hobby itself and
why it can be interesting for many people.

## I have a mobile phone. Why do I need amateur radio?

This might not be the hobby for you, and that's okay!

Keep in mind that mobile phones are just small radios that transmit and
receive digital data all day long. If that interests you and you want to
tinker on similar technologies, amateur radio might be good for you. Using a
radio to call long distances (say, across the USA) on a frequent basis can be
frustrating if you just need something that works all the time.

However, consider those situations where mobile phones do not work, such as
natural disasters. Communication falls back to radios during these difficult
times and you may be able to assist with emergencies or get information for
your family with some knowledge of amateur radio.

## I thought amateur radio was just for old people.

That's a common misconception, but there are many older people involved in
amateur radio for a variety of reasons.

Many military veterans had to work with radios during their miltary career
and they find that amateur radio is a fun way to keep their skills sharp. It
can also be a fun way to talk to other veterans on the radio and at club
meetings.

Amateur radio is something you can do even if you have physical limitations
caused by injury, illness, or old age. Some hams have large towers with
complex wiring and unique antennas. Others plop down a small vertical or
magnetic loop on a desk and transmit from there.

There's a great benefit to older folks being involved with amateur radio:
**they can teach you a lot**. Often called *elmers* in ham radio vernacular,
these are people who can prevent you from making costly mistakes in planning
your station and they can show you some unique ways to fix radio problems. If
you don't mind taking a little direction, many of these experienced hams will
overwhelm you with radio knowledge that you can put to use immediately.

With that said, there are plenty of younger people getting involved with ham
radio. There are plenty of newer technologies, especially digital modes, that
allow newer operators to mix over-the-air radio operations with functionality
over the internet.

## Can I just listen and see if it's interesting?

Of course! In the United States, you can listen to any amateur radio
transmission anytime with very inexpensive equipment. No licensing or
expertise is required to listen.

You can pick up a shortwave radio and listen to long-distance transmissions,
or you can buy a handheld transceiver (often called an *HT*) to listen to
local discussions.

Your local hams might have a repeater set up to rebroadcast local radio
transmissions over a long distance. Head over to [RepeaterBook] to find your
local repeaters and listen! I wrote a [lengthy post about repeaters] in 2018.

If you want to go a bit further, [find your local radio club online] and go
to one of their meetings! Tell them that you're new to the hobby and I'm sure
they will be happy to show you some of their uses for radio. You might even
discover a use that you never considered.

# Getting a license {#license}

Licensing is very specific to the country where you live. This section is
specific to getting licensed in the United States.

## I heard radio operators have license levels. What's in each level?

There are three main licensing levels:

1. Technician
2. General
3. Extra

You must pass a test to move up to the next level.

Technician gives you access to **lots** of frequencies, but the amount of
things you can do below the 10 meter band is very limited. General opens the
door to many of the frequencies below 10 meters, but Extra class licensees
have the most access to those bands.

To learn more about what access each level gets, consult the [ARRL Band Plan]
or review the handy [graphical band chart] (which is good for printing).

[ARRL Band Plan]: http://www.arrl.org/band-plan
[graphical band chart]: http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Regulatory/Band%20Chart/Band%20Chart%20-%2011X17%20Color.pdf

## What's on the test?

At a very high level, each test consists of questions in these areas:

* Procedures, rules, process
* Electrical circuits
* Safety
* Inner workings of radios and antennas

The great thing is that every single test (and its answers) is available to
you online! Review the [question pools] at any time!

[question pools]: http://www.arrl.org/question-pools

## How should I study for the test?

You have plenty of choices and hams will often argue which is best.

[HamStudy] is my go-to resource for studying and for reference after the
exam. You can review content and take practice exams right on your computer
for free. They also offer some mobile apps (for a fee, totally worth it) so
you can study from wherever you are. Their site works well on Android devices
right in the browser, so that may work for you as well.

Another option is to get a book! The ARRL offers [study guides and reference
material] for each license level. Some people learn better from offline books
than electronic screens, and this could be the right option for you. Just be
sure that the book you order matches the license level and the test currently
being used. The tests are rotated out about every four years, so make sure
the book is up to date.

You could also get the question and answer pools (see the previous question
above) and go over all of those. This requires some brute force memorization
and you may not learn the theory behind the questions.

Keep in mind that rote memorization **will** get you past the test, but then
you could make quite a few expensive or dangerous mistakes as you try to get
on the air.

**Don't just try to beat the test. Learn the theory!** You will thank me
later when you're trying to get your SWR in check on a dipole using the wrong
feed line that has a high impedance. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Where do I go to take the test?

Once again, ARRL has you covered. Fill in your location information and
[search for a test near you]. In the San Antonio area, there are 3-4 testing
locations that run tests on Saturdays. There's a test almost every weekend.

Keep in mind that some groups will only test if someone sends them a note to
say they are coming to take a test. It requires a minimum of three volunteer
examiners (*VEs*) to be present and they are exactly that -- volunteers! Most
groups have an email address or phone number for you to contact if you want
to take a test.

Be sure to note the fee for testing! It's usually $15, but it may be
different in some places.

If you're in the San Antonio, Texas area, I highly recommend [the ROOST].
They are a friendly bunch of folks in a relaxed shack and they keep the
examinees relaxed with plenty of jokes. You may spot a cat poke its head in
the shack. I'm told that's a good omen. üò∫

## It's test day! What do I bring?

Before you leave the house, you will need a FCC Registration Number (*FRN*)
if you want things to go as smoothly as possible. Test results are submitted
by hand on paper that goes through the postal mail. Yes, I know.

Luckily, the FCC has good documentation on [getting your FRN]. By getting
your FRN ahead of time, you will ensure that your test results are processed
as quickly as humanly possible once they reach the FCC.

Now that you're ready to go, grab these items:

* Government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, military ID, etc)
* Good pencil
* Small basic calculator (optional, but better be safe than sorry)
* Testing fee (see previous section)
* Your FRN *(you did get your FRN, didn't you?)*

Good luck on your test!

## What should I expect when I take the exam?

Most ham radio exams are extremely relaxed and the VEs are often very
experienced radio operators who want more people to join the hobby. You are
definitely with good people.

Once you get signed in and you complete some paperwork (which includes your
FRN, which I'm **sure** you brought with you), you will pay the testing fee.
There are various versions of the test and you'll get one from the pile and
sit down to take your test.

Here's each test, its length, and required passing grade:

* Technician: 35 questions; must get 26 or more correct
* General: same as Technician
* Extra: 50 questions; must get 37 or more correct

You'll turn in your exam and get your grade right there! You have two options
after that:

* If you passed, you can take the General exam at no cost. There's no harm in
  trying it. Some people are able to pass it if they studied some of the
  material!

* If you failed, don't worry. It happens to the best of us. You can take it
  one more time at no additional cost! You can do it!

When everything is over and you pass at least one of the exams, the VEs will
complete a form called the Certificate of Successful Completion of
Examination (or *CSCE*). Your CSCE is your record of passing the exam. **Put
your copy in a safe place!** If it gets lost in the mail, you may need to
provide that copy.

Your VEs will submit that CSCE along with other paperwork to the FCC. This
can take 7-10 business days to complete, or longer if you didn't create an
FRN first. Log in at the [License Manager] (*ULS*) with your FRN and
password. As soon as your license is available, you'll see it there!

## I got my license and my new callsign, but my callsign is terrible!

You can apply for a vanity callsign with the FCC for free so long as the
callsign you want is available and it's of the appropriate format for your
license class. There is some great documentation on [applying for a vanity
callsign] on ARRL's site.
