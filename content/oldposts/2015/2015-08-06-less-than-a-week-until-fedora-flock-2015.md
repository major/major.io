This will be my first ever trip to New York and I'm looking forward to it!

I'll be speaking about [impostor syndrome][3] in my "Be an inspiration, not an impostor" talk on Thursday, August 13th. It's a topic that hits close to home for me since I've wrestled with it quite a few times. Fortunately, it's easy to overcome if we're able to identify it in our colleagues and give them the right support. It's amazing to see what happens when amazing people get over the hump and have an honest self-assessment of their capabilities.

Thanks to [Rackspace][4] for being a gold sponsor and for sending me to join the Fedora community in Rochester. I'll be sure to share my slides along with a conference recap when I get back.
