It has finally arrived. MySQLTuner 1.0.0 is now available for [download][1]. Major improvements include full support for MySQL 5.1 and Solaris. You can review other changes in the [changelog][2].

As always, I'd like to personally thank everyone who has made this release possible. Your efforts have provided benefits from MySQL users worldwide, and they have shown me how rewarding it is to maintain open source software.
