I'm going to take two weeks off from posting on RackerHacker and I'm going to put that time towards bringing the next version of [boxcheck.com][1] to fruition. I've been hit with a lot of requests, and it seems to be a tool that people find pretty useful!

I'll keep updating the blog as I get closer to releasing the next version. Also, as soon as a beta is available, I will certainly let you know!
