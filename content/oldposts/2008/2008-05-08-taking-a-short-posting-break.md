I'll be taking a short break from posting, but I should be back underway within week! Â Here's what I'm working on during the break:

  * **MySQLTuner** - Thank you for all of the e-mails with suggestions, patches and complaints. The 1.0 version of [MySQLTuner][1] is in the works and I hope that it helps you get more done with your MySQL server.
  * **Boxcheck** - A new version of [boxcheck.com][2] is coming and it will include more tests for you to use. Also, the tests that it already has will be more reliable. I might even throw in a little AJAX to get everyone excited.
  * **PleskHacker** - I'm still working on the [Plesk database documentation][3], but this project is a lower priority than the first two.

I'm [moving into a new house][4] over the weekend, so please [don't be discouraged][5] if you e-mail me and you don't receive a quick response. For all of the fans of Twitter out there, you can find me on Twitter as [RackerHacker][6].
