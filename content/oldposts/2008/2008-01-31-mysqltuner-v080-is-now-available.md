Thanks to an e-mail from Joe Calderon, I've corrected a MySQLTuner bug where indexes were not being calculated properly when symbolic links are used. It was a quick fix, and the new version is [now available for download][1].

Also, MySQLTuner now has a standardized versioning scheme. I'm starting at 0.8.0 since I'm close to a completely stable release. There's still a few kinks when working with MySQL cluster nodes, and I'm hoping to work that out soon.

Thanks for downloading!
