OpenStack comes home to Austin on Monday for the [OpenStack Summit][1]! I will be there with [plenty of other Rackers][2] to learn, collaborate, and share our story.

![3]

If you're interested in applying automated security hardening to an OpenStack cloud, be sure to [drop by my talk][4] on Tuesday from 11:15 to 11:55 AM. I'll explain how Rackspace uses the [openstack-ansible-security][5] Ansible role to automatically apply hardening standards to servers in an OpenStack private cloud. If you aren't able to attend, don't worry. I will post my slides and a summary here on the blog.

Here are the sessions on the top of my list:

  * [Ops: Large Deployments Team][6]
  * [DEFCON 3: OpenStack Meets the Information Security Department][7]
  * [Nova Cells V2: What's Going On?][8]
  * [Continuous Compliance & Enforcement of Location-Based Policies in an OpenStack Cloud][9]
  * [Using Open Source Security Architecture to Defend against Targeted Attacks][10]
  * [Load Balancing as a Service, Mitaka and Beyond][11]

If you're at the Summit and you want to meet, feel free to email me at major@mhtx.net or [connect with me on Twitter][12]. I hope it's a great week!
