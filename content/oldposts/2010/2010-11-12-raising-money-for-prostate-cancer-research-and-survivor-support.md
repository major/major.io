![movember] Movember 2010

This is a bit of an unusual post for my blog, but I wanted to reach out to you for charitable reasons. I'm currently trying to grow some facial hair (which is a feat in itself) with some folks from work for the [Movember Foundation][1]. I look a bit sillier than usual, but at least it's for a good cause.

The Movember Foundation currently passes along the proceeds to the [Prostate Cancer Foundation][2] and [LIVESTRONG][3].

If you'd like to make a donation, you can [do that on my member page][4].
