Although the X1 Carbon has a [much better looking display than the T430s][1], it still looked a bit washed out when I compared it to other monitors right next to it. The entire display had a weak blue tint and it was difficult to use for extended periods, especially at maximum brightness.

A quick Google search took me to a [LaunchPad entry][2] about a [better ICC profile for the X1 Carbon][3]. After applying the ICC file via GNOME Control Center's Color panel, the display looks fantastic.

Feel free to download a copy of the color profile and try it for yourself:
