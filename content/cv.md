## Professional Summary

I love digging into problems that involve people, processes, and technology.
When someone says "it can't be done" or "it's too complicated", I jump at the
opportunity (especially when it means learning something new in the process).

Once I learn something new, I write about it and teach as many people as I can.
This [blog](/posts) started in 2007 and it covers a broad spectrum of topics
from system administration to software development to personal career growth.

## Skills

* **Software development:** I spend most of my time writing Python and shell
  scripts.
* **Systems engineering:** I use Ansible, Terraform, and Packer to manage my
  cloud deployments and local systems at home. My monitoring setup includes
  Prometheus, Grafana, and various exporters that Prometheus scrapes.
* **Networking:** Most of my networking experience involves Linux-based routers
  and firewalls, but I frequently use Mikrotik RouterOS and EdgeRouter/VyOS
  devices. I maintain several Wireguard network links in addition to some
  Tailscale meshes. There's still a little OpenVPN around, too.
* **Open source contributions:** I served on the Fedora Project Board from
  2012-2014, [participated] in the OpenStack project, and I [maintain lots of
  packages] in Fedora. I launched the [ansible-hardening] project within
  OpenStack. You can find plenty of open source work over at [GitHub].
  I built [icanhazip.com] and recently [transferred ownership to Cloudflare].
* **Leadership:** My experience includes director-level roles responsible for
  budgets, people management, and mentoring. I love helping others find a way to
  level up in the technical capabilities and in their job role.

## Work experience

### Red Hat (2018)

I work at Red Hat now as a RHEL Cloud Architect. My main focus is to make the
RHEL on cloud experience as good, if not better, than the on-premises
experience.

In the past, I worked with the Image Builder team as we build a robust platform
for building and deploying RHEL cloud images to various public clouds. Before
that, I worked on the Continuous Kernel Integration team to provide CI/CD for
the Linux kernel inside and outside of Red Hat.

### Rackspace (2006-2018)

I wore plenty of hats at Rackspace (and sometimes more than one at the same
time):

* Chief Security Architect, Director
* Principal Architect - OpenStack
* Cloud Architect - Cloud Servers
* Linux Engineer, OpenStack
* Engineering Manager, Cloud Servers Operations
* Senior Systems Engineer
* Linux Systems Administrator

### SecureTrust Corporation (2004-2006)

*SecureTrust Corporation now is a wholly owned subsidiary of TrustWave Holdings,
Inc.*

* VP of Operations
* Lead Developer

### American Medical Response (2002-2003)

* Field Medic / EMT

## Education

Antonio in December 2004. ü§ôüèª
