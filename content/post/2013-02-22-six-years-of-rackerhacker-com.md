It's that time of year again:

```
$ whois rackerhacker.com | grep date
Creation date: 14 Feb 2007 00:22:00
Expiration date: 14 Feb 2017 00:22:00
```

**The blog is now six years old!** Thanks to everyone who has followed it, commented, and suggested new topics for posts.

You may have noticed that I'm adding content a bit slower than I usually do, and that's probably due to two big factors: we have a newborn at the house and [my work at Rackspace has totally changed][1]. I've received quite a few ideas for new posts from readers and I've come up with some of my own. Thanks to some help from a friend, I should have some more posts on the [Rackspace Blog][2] as well this year.
