I've discovered one of the most awesome applications for a Mac called [ScreenFlow][1] (#3 on my list after #1 [TextMate][2] and #2 [Adium][3] and I decided to put it to use for my first screencast.

This screencast will teach you how to write a basic PHP script that will query data in MySQL. It is designed for users who are familiar with Linux but are just getting started with PHP. Here are the basic parts of the screencast:

» Import a MySQL dump file

» Connect to MySQL with PHP

» Select a default database

» Issue a query and retrieve results

» Style the rows retrieved into a table with alternating row colors

[Download the screencast in Quicktime format (80.9MB)][4]

**NEW:** [Uploaded the video to Vimeo as well.][5]

As always, your comments are welcome. This is my first screencast, and I'm sure I can make some improvements on future videos. Please let me know what I can change to make these screencasts better for you.
