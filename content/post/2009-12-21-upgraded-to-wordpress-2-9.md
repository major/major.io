If you haven't [upgraded][1] your [WordPress][2] installation to version 2.9 yet, you might want to consider doing that soon. There are quite a few [improvements, bug fixes and security features][3] available in the new version.

The automatic upgrade via the admin interface actually worked just fine for me. Of course, I backed up my database and files first, just to be sure.
