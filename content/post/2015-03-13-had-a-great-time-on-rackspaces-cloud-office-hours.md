[Alan Bush][1] was kind enough to invite me on his [Cloud Office Hours][2] hangout here at Rackspace yesterday:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8Cpaxhzd80?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

We talked about a wide array of topics, including information security, the [icanhazip project][3], this blog, and [my resume][4]. The session wouldn't be complete without a mention of systemd and [SELinux][5]. ;)

They asked some good questions, but my favorite was:

> If you did a TED talk, what would you talk about?

That's quite a provocative question and it wasn't one I'd thought about before. As I said in the video, my goal would be to talk about how you shouldn't let a degree (or lack of one) define you. More on that soon.
