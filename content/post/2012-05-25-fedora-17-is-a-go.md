If all goes well, we should see the [formal release on May 29][3].

As some of you might have noticed, I'm a fan of Xen. If you want to get Fedora 17 rolling in XenServer right now, just try my [minimal kickstart][4]. I'll try to get a XVA/OVF-formatted image online in the next few days so you can hit the ground running if you're in a hurry.

Check out the new [Fedora 17 features and improvements][5] and prepare yourself for the [Beefy Miracle][6].
