**Update: I've removed the guide as it has aged quite a bit and is not very helpful.**

Today, on my 28th birthday, I'm finally delivering on a promise to my readers which I made about two months ago. I've [written a guide][1] on how to host a web application redundantly in a cloud environment. While it's still a bit of a rough draft, it should be a good starting point for those who haven't worked in virtualized environments before. Also, it may show some of the more experienced systems administrators a new way to do things.

The guide: [Redundant Cloud Hosting Guide][1]

As always, if you find anything in the guide that needs improvement, I'm all ears. :-)
