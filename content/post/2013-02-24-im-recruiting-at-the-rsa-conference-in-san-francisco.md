</div>RSA: Recruiting Security Architects - that's what I'm doing! (See what I did there?)

Are you planning to attend the RSA Conference in San Francisco this year? Are you looking for a new career with a security team that strives to break the mold of traditional security? If so, [apply for the open position][1] and let's meet at the conference. I'll be glad to answer questions about what makes security at Rackspace so unique.

We're looking for enthusiastic Security Architects who think that securing a company as dynamic as Rackspace is more than just a job. Our team constantly finds new ways to do the traditional work of securing the business. We still do much of the traditional security work, like assessments, compliance programs, and incident response, but we take an entirely different approach. Imagine a security environment where policy creation is collaborative with less friction when it comes time for implementation. That's just the tip of the iceberg.

**Interested?** Get in touch with me to learn more.
