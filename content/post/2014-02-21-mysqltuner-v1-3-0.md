It's been three long years since the last MySQLTuner release but you'll now find [version 1.3.0][1] available on GitHub. You can get it from the [git repository][2] or via these extremely simple methods:

```
wget -O mysqltuner.pl mysqltuner.pl
wget --trust-server-names mysqltuner.pl
```


There are a bunch of new features and fixes that you can find in the [list of commits from today][3] (2014-02-21). Some of the bigger adjustments include:

  * Basic support for MariaDB 10.x
  * A more flexible storage engine display
  * Better support for darwin, solaris, and BSD variants
  * Version checking is removed until I can find a better method
  * Fixed a divide by zero error with a key\_buffer\_size set to 0
  * Custom paths to `mysqladmin` are now supported with a command line parameter

I'd still like to convert this script over to python and make it installable from pypi. That's a work in progress.
