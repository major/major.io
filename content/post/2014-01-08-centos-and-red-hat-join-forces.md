I'd like to congratulate the CentOS project on their [big news yesterday][1]. The [CentOS website][2] received a refresh and there's a [new concept of variants][3] being proposed. After talking to [Karanbir Singh][4] and [Robyn Bergeron][5] yesterday, it was obvious that they're both really excited about the changes.

If you're looking for more details on the changes, here are some handy links:

  * [Robyn Bergeron's blog post][6]
  * [Red Hat and CentOS FAQ][7]

The media coverage has some entertaining headlines:

  * [Hell Freezes Over in Linux Land as Red Hat Makes Nice With Its Clone][8]
  * [Red Hat and CentOS become Voltron, build free operating system together][9]
