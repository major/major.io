One of the most important lessons in technology that I've ever learned is that the technology isn't everything. People build technology and people determine its value in their lives. Companies often go through periods of uncertainty for various reasons and these times make it challenging for individual contributors and leaders to persevere.

An email from [Harvard Business Review][1] landed in my inbox recently with a link to an article on their site. The article, [How to Keep Your Team Focused and Productive During Uncertain Times][2], talked about the things that leaders can do to ensure their teams endure, and even prosper, during challenging times.

## Make it easier

The article has plenty of valuable tips (go ahead and read it), but there isn't a good framework in there to help with remembering all of the steps. Then I remembered something - [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs][3].

The Wikipedia page provides a detailed explanation, but the basic idea is that you can't move up the stack unless the bottom layers are solid. For example, someone can't build self-esteem if their safety needs are not met.

## What to do

As a leader or manager (I look at those as two different things; more on that later), you must ensure your own needs are being fulfilled first. If you're unsure about those, it may be a good time to talk to your manager about them.

Next, work through some observations and questions for the people on your team or the people that you lead. You can step through each layer of the pyramid to understand how people on the team are doing.

### Physiological

Some managers may feel like this is a little outside their job description, but it is definitely not. I've led people before who are having problems with a stable place to sleep at night or are having financial problems so challenging that their ability to get food is limited.

Much of this information can be gathered through observations rather than a direct question. If it's difficult for someone to move onto the other layers of the hierarchy, there might be a problem here. Talk to the person about it and find out if there are other resources at work (ask HR for sure) that could help them get back on their feet.

### Safety

This is another one that managers sometimes take for granted. People who are working through significant health issues (or who have someone in their family who is) will have trouble belonging at work (the next level). It's challenging to feel like you belong at work when you spend all day thinking about your health or the health of someone else.

This is another good opportunity to get outside the office and talk to the person about it. They might not want to share details - and that's completely okay - but it's good for you to understand that they're going through some real challenges. Ask what you can do to help and find out what resources are available for them if they need them.

### Social belonging

Observations help a lot here and it's helpful to understand that everyone is different. You may notice that most of the team goes out to eat and one team member doesn't. It could be that the person really enjoys that quiet time alone to get extra work done. Or, it could be that the person has a food allergy or other digestive condition that limits their lunch choices. It could be something else entirely.

If you're concerned, talk to them about their preferences and see if they're happy with them. If they really enjoy that time alone, let them do it! (It would be good to encourage them to go with the team every so often if possible, though.) If they feel like they can't go because of some reason, see if you can find a way to discreetly alter the lunch plans so that person can be included.

It's all about **how much belonging** the person wants and the **type of belonging** that makes them feel comfortable. What looks like a person who doesn't belong (the person who stays behind at lunch) to you, may look completely normal to someone else.

### Esteem

This is a great opportunity to learn about impostor syndrome. I've written about it [several times on this blog][4] and I've given [several talks about it][5]. There are plenty of ways to help people understand where their confidence level is and where it should be.

This is especially important with people on either end of the experience level graph. Brand new team members may feel overwhelmed while the most experienced team members may not feel challenged.

### Self-actualization

Most 1:1's between a manager and a report should be on this level once a rapport is built with trust. This level is challenging to reach and it forces
