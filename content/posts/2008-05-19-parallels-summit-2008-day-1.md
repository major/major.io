I'm really enjoying the [Parallels Summit in Washington D.C.][1] this week. The folks from Parallels have been great, and the vendors we have met are selling some pretty tremendous products.

Lots of folks have been asking for a summary of what's going on after my [Twitter posts][2] appeared earlier today. Here's the latest information I've seen and heard today:

**Parallels Development Strategy**

&raquo; Create an SMB edition, solidity the Application Packaging Standard (APS), and further integrate billing

&raquo; 80+ Research and development engineers currently work on Plesk products

&raquo; Increase density and make a more useable API

&raquo; Make Plesk the dominant panel through integration, SaaS deployments and scaling

**Plesk 8 Series**

&raquo; Plesk 8.4 brought DomainKeys and additional features

&raquo; Odd point revisions will contain minor bug fixes while even ones will contain new features

&raquo; Plesk 8.6 will have IPv6 support, full ModernBill integration and the APS software catalog

**Plesk 9 Series**

&raquo; Reseller level accounts will be available, and they will fit between the server administrator and client accounts

&raquo; Clients can be promoted to resellers

&raquo; Domain administrators can be promoted to clients (and resellers)

&raquo; Home and desktop pages will be merged

&raquo; Better rollover tooltips will be provided

&raquo; Hosting setup will be easier and setting limits will be more intuitive

&raquo; Server administrators will be able to hide certain services and functions

&raquo; Overselling will be allowed so that soft and hard limits can be set

&raquo; API improvements will be backward compatible

&raquo; Reseller billing will be integrated with ModernBill

&raquo; Choose to use Postfix rather than Qmail

&raquo; Greylisting is built into the panel

**Plesk Future Ideas**

&raquo; Vast majority of Plesk deployments have five domains or less

&raquo; SMB edition with support for one domain and one administrator (SaaS)

&raquo; Corporate fileserver and collaboration will be in the SMB version

&raquo; Use PHP via FastCGI rather than Apache module

&raquo; Lighttpd support for Plesk panel as well as hosted sites

&raquo; Multiple MTA's (in addition to Postfix/Qmail)

&raquo; Upgrade checks can be run prior to upgrading Plesk so that issues can be avoided

&raquo; Recovery tools will be available for broken upgrades

&raquo; Local Plesk mirrors can be used to do remote upgrades

&raquo; Multiple level backup/restore options for admin, reseller, client or domain administrator

&raquo; Migration of shared hosting environment into Virtuozzo container or Plesk Server container

&raquo; SiteBuilder 5.0 will have mobile web site design support

&raquo; Event calendar is coming

**ModernBill**

&raquo; Will be integrated into Plesk

&raquo; Support for 20+ payment gateways

&raquo; 100% ready in Q4 2008

**Application Packaging Standard (APS)**

&raquo; Applications will be available directly from Parallels within the Plesk panel

&raquo; Modules are easy to install and update

&raquo; Applications can be maintained by packagers and kept up to date

&raquo; Centralized license management

&raquo; Installation and configuration can be completely scripted

&raquo; Install scripts can get Plesk configuration data right from Plesk so the interface within the application matches Plesk's interface

**Notes from Sergei's Keynote**

&raquo; Hosting growth is slowing, but it mature

&raquo; Managed hosting is growing a lot, and SaaS has entered the marked

&raquo; Mentioned Rackspace's pending IPO as a sign of the changing market

&raquo; Large SaaS entries: Google's products, Amazon's S3/EC2, Microsoft's Hosted Exchange

&raquo; Google is a monopoly, the most dangerous, won't partner with anyone

&raquo; Microsoft works harder on partnerships, but was more dangerous without Yahoo!

&raquo; EMC quietly launched direct hosting, storage hosting, cloud computing

&raquo; IT is mocing off-premises, which is both a threat and opportunity

&raquo; Hosting companies must stay competitive via pricing, high levels of service

&raquo; Create stickyness with critical service offerings and owning the customer (and their data)

&raquo; Hosting companies can improve with broad sets of service plans, flexible upgrade paths, and close ties with customers/partners

&raquo; Parallels vision includes partnering, automation, virtualization, and standardization

I'll try to take good notes tomorrow and get an update together for you then!
