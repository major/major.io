I'm always impressed with the content published by folks at [Etsy][1] and [Ben Hughes'][2] [presentation from DevOpsDays Minneapolis 2014][3] is no exception.

Ben adds some levity to the topic of information security with some hilarious (but relevant) images and reminds us that security is an active process that everyone must practice. Everyone plays a part - not just traditional corporate security employees.

I've embedded the presentation here for your convenience:
