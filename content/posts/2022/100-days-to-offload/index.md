title: Taking the 100 Days to Offload challenge
---

While scrolling through toots in my [Mastodon account] recently, I stumbled upon the **#100DaysToOffload** hashtag.
That led me to the [100 Days To Offload] challenge.

The challenge looks very straightforward: write 100 posts within one year on your blog.
There's no prize involved other than being able to share your ideas with others.

However, one problem stands in my way:
_I'm suffering from some serious writer's block._

# Getting unblocked

Wikipedia [provides the best summary] of writer's block:

> Writer's block is a condition, primarily associated with writing, in which an author is either unable to produce new work or experiences a creative slowdown.

Both of these are getting in my way, but wait, I seem to writing about this problem. 🤔

Perhaps I forgot one of my most important writing rules: [write for you, not for anyone else]. 
I've written several posts lately and then thought "nobody will find that useful" or "I'll just get flamed for writing that."
Those posts eventually met their fate of a sad, quiet `git clean` followed by a long sigh.

I lost my reason for writing and it's time to get it back.

# Improving my workflow

I [mentioned my writing workflow recently] on Mastodon and how I want to improve it.
The focus must be on the writing itself.
Inefficient tools and tiresome routines steal that energy and give me excuses to stop writing.

Much of my blog post drafting time was spent finding just the right image for the post, getting it sized down appropriately, and then carefully attributing the source.
I love finding beautiful pictures to accompany my posts but I didn't realize how much time was involved with finding all of those images.
As I look back now, many of these photos (as beautiful as they are) really didn't add any value to the post because they often weren't relevant to the content.

I'll keep my VSCode/vim markdown workflow but I plan to drop the cover images for each post.
It's less work for each post and less data to host and transfer around at publishing time.

# Expanding topics

While I've usually written about technology and career advice in the past, I plan to expand more of my posts on investing[^majorstrades] and health.
I'll use the right hashtags on Mastodon toots to make posts easier to find and you can always use the [tags] to find the topics you enjoy.
