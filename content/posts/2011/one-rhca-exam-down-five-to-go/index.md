[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Major_Hayden_EX442-300x231.jpg" alt="EX442" title="EX442" width="300" height="231" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2115" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Major_Hayden_EX442-300x231.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Major_Hayden_EX442-1024x790.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]While I'm not the biggest proponent of certifications, I still think you can learn some valuable information while studying for some certification tests. A good example of that is Red Hat's [System Monitoring and Performance Tuning Expertise Exam][2]. It's one test out of five in the [Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA)][3] track of exams. I passed the exam this week and it's definitely one of the most difficult certification exams I've ever taken.

Many of the [topics covered on the EX442 exam][4] are really handy for Linux system administrators. The advanced filesystem configuration, software RAID optimization, and process scheduling knowledge can provide some tangible performance gains on just about any Linux server.

I especially enjoyed learning about [SystemTap][5]. I'd heard about it before, but I never really understood what it did and how much power it can give a system administrator on a server. You can [sample a wide variety of system events][6] quickly with relative ease and you're not bound to the hardware dependencies of [OProfile][7].

Bear in mind that you'll need a valid [RHCE][8] to get started with the RHCA exams. That's another certification that I'd definitely recommend as it helps you learn a wide variety of administration topics that can be applied to almost any Linux distribution available today.
