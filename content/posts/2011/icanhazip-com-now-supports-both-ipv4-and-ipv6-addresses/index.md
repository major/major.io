title: icanhazip.com now supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
---

If you're a fan of [icanhazip.com][1], you'll be excited to know that it now supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The icanhazip.com domain now has A and AAAA records, so you should now be able to reach it on connections that are IPv6 only.

Should you find yourself in a situation in which you need to force it to display your IPv4 or IPv6 address (which is handy if you are running a dual stack), simply access ipv4.icanhazip.com or ipv6.icanhazip.com. Those sites will always return your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively.

As always, if you find any bugs or other problems, be sure to let me know!
