Due to popular demand, I've created a mailing list for MySQLTuner. It will be a low-traffic list consisting of new version announcements and bug fixes.

If you want to subscribe, simply send an e-mail with **SUBSCRIBE** in the subject line to [mysqltuner-announce-request@mysqltuner.com][1]. Be sure to add **mysqltuner-announce@mysqltuner.com** to your mail provider's whitelist.
