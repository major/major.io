The schedule can be overwhelming for first timers and it can be difficult at times to discern the technical sessions from the ones that are more sales-oriented.

If you're in San Francisco, and you want to learn a bit more about using Ansible to manage OpenStack environments, come to the session that I am co-presenting with Robyn Bergeron: [When flexibility met simplicity: The friendship of OpenStack and Ansible][3].

## Confirmed good sessions

Here's a list of sessions that I've seen in the past and I still highly recommend:

  * [Security-enhanced Linux for mere mortals][4] from Thomas Cameron
  * [Container security][5] from Dan Walsh

Dan is also doing a lab for container security called "[A practical introduction to container security][6]" that should be really interesting if you enjoy his regular sessions.

## Sessions I want to see this year

  * [Are you listening to what SELinux is telling you][7] from Dan Walsh and Roland Wolters
  * [Optimizing code for modern processors][8] from William Cohen
  * [Ansible BoF][9] from Greg DeKoenigsberg and James Cammarata
  * [Docker versis Systemd - Can't we just get along?][10] from Dan Walsh
  * [Tracking huge files with Git LFS][11] from Tim Pettersen
  * [Developer meet designer][12] from Andres Galante and Brian Leathern

If you want to talk OpenStack, Ansible, or Rackspace at the Summit, send me something [on Twitter][13]. Have a great time!
