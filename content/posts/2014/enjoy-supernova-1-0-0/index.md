title: Enjoy supernova 1.0.0
---

The [first supernova commit][1] to GitHub appeared just over two years ago. It's been stable for quite some time, but it's made it to version 1.0.0 today!

As always, you can get supernova from PyPi using pip:

```
pip install -U supernova
```


All of the [documentation has moved][2] to ReadTheDocs and it looks much better than the giant README file in GitHub that served as the documentation for so long. Thanks to everyone that has committed code, found bugs, or called out my inability to write Python!
