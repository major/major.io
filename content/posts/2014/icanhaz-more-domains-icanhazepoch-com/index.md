Sometimes I can't help myself. I like to buy domains and use them for interesting activities. This tweet cropped up in my stream tonight:

You can give it a try now: [icanhazepoch.com][1]

```
$ curl icanhazepoch.com
1393036551
```


I'm doing my best to keep the server time in sync, so it should be relatively reliable. However, I wouldn't recommend using it for launching satellites or timing anything where someone's life is held in the balance. If you don't know why this warning is here, [read up on NTP jitter][2].

Thanks to [@claco][3] for the idea and to [Namecheap][4] for fueling my domain purchasing addiction.
