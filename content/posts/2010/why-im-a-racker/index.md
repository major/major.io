title: Why I’m a Racker

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1346" title="Why I'm A Racker - Rackspace Talent blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/whyimaracker-rackspacetalent-300x213.jpg" alt="Why I'm A Racker - Rackspace Talent blog" width="300" height="213" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/whyimaracker-rackspacetalent-300x213.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/03/whyimaracker-rackspacetalent.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]I normally try to keep my work-related items separate from this blog, but I felt that I needed to break tradition for a moment.  The new [Rackspace Talent][2] site was released a few weeks ago and [Michael Long][3] asked me to write a blog post about what it means to be a Racker (that's the term we use for employees of Rackspace).

After the post went up, I received as much feedback from people outside of Rackspace as I received from Rackers.  The negative feedback I received was centered around the assertion that the post's content was "fluffed" to make the Rackspace experience seem better than it actually is.  That couldn't be further from the truth.

If you want to make comments on the post, or if you want to know more about working at Rackspace, let me know.  Although I'm not in sales and I'm not in recruiting, I always enjoy talking to people about using Rackspace's services or working for Rackspace.
