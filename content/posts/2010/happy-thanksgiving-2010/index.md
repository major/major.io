title: Happy Thanksgiving
---

For those of us in the United States, we celebrate [Thanksgiving][1] today. Although it means different things for different people, I consider it to be a good day to remember those who have helped us and count the blessings that we all take for granted.

Without a doubt, I'm most thankful for my family. They're my support base and I couldn't get through my days without them.

I wish I could thank my coworkers, mentors, and close friends individually, but this blog post would get rather lengthy. To everyone who has had taken the time to teach me something: I thank you. You've inspired me to continue learning and inspire others to do the same.

Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families. Please travel safely and take some time to relax.
