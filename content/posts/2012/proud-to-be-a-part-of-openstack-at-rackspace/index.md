title: Proud to be a part of OpenStack at Rackspace
---

Troy Toman delivered a great keynote this morning about OpenStack and how Rackspace uses it:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP9XaajglPg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>

I'm extremely glad to be a tiny part of the OpenStack story and I'm proud to see where it's going today. My goals are to make OpenStack environments easier to deploy, maintain and administer. Along with other Rackers, we're making this happen each day and we plan to share our successes and hardships with the community.

If you're interested in working on OpenStack at Rackspace, feel free to reach out to me or [learn more about our open positions][1].
