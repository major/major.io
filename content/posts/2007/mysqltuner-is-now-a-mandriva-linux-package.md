title: MySQLTuner is now a Mandriva Linux package!
---

Thanks to Oden Eriksson at Mandriva, MySQLTuner is now [packaged into an RPM][1] for easier installations on Mandriva Linux.

More data can be found in the [Mandriva Linux Archives][2].

_As an aside, I find it quite interesting that the first package for my script popped up on Mandriva. My first adventure into Linux was with Mandrake many years ago._
