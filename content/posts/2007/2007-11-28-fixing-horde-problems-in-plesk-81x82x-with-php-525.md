There's a few issues with PHP 5.2.5 and the version of Horde that is bundled with Plesk 8.1.x and 8.2.x. The PHP include paths that appear in the Apache configuration generated by Plesk conflict with the PHP installation, and that causes the Horde webmail interface to segmentation fault.

To fix the problem, create a file called `/etc/httpd/conf.d/zz050a_horde_php_workaround.conf` and put the following inside it:

```apache
<DirectoryMatch /usr/share/psa-horde>
php_admin_value include_path "/usr/share/psa-horde/lib:/usr/share/psa-horde:/usr/share/psa-horde/pear:."
</DirectoryMatch>
```

Reload the Apache configuration and your Horde installation should work properly with PHP 5.2.5.

_Credit for this fix goes to Kevin M._
