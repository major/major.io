title: Sub-par DNS stuff at DNSStuff
---

If you're like me, you're frustrated with DNSStuff's actions lately. You only get 4 lookups without making a login, and even when you make a login, you have to log back in each time you access the site. Even a dim-witted web developer would know how to use cookies to automate this process and make things easier on the users.

Also, why should you pay for a web front-end for tools that people have on their servers already?

Check out [Boxcheck.com][1] and let me know what you think. I became so fed up, I decided to make my own site that is faster and guaranteed free forever. Period.
