title: Quick and fancy mail blacklist checking
---

I rarely try to toot my own horn, but I've created a pretty handy site. Check out [Blacklist Watch][1] if you get the chance. You can immediately test a server against the most commonly used spam blacklists available online. Soon enough, I'll have an automated notification service so that you can be notified when your IP's appear on a blacklist.

[Here's a quick example of the blacklist checking][2].
