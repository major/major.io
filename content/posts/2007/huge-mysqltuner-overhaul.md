title: Huge MySQLTuner overhaul
---

I've been flooded with requests for MySQLTuner and I've answered them this weekend. Here's the changes that were made:

  * Specific variable recommendations are made with suggested values as well
  * Odd recommendations have been reduced
  * Some math errors were corrected
  * More configuration items are supported, like table locks, thread caching, table caching and open file limits.

To find out more and to download the script, head on over to [mysqltuner.com][1].
