title: MySQLTuner Revision 20 is available
---

I've updated MySQLTuner to revision 20 tonight, and it has the following improvements:

* Added NetBSD support (thanks to Dave Burgess)

* Switched username/password prompts to STDERR so they won't appear in printouts

[Downloads are available][1], or you can do a new [subversion checkout][2].
