title: Boxcheck.com improvements
---

I've been hard at work on the [boxcheck.com][1] site, and there's plenty of improvements. The new interface is quicker, easier to use, and it uses ajax for a more Web 2.0 feel (can't believe I just said Web 2.0).

Some beta testers are already giving it a whirl, and I hope to have it released to the public later next week!
