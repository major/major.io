I'm striving to keep the topics of this blog as technical as possible since that what most readers keep asking for. Tech talk is always something I enjoy, but one of my other big passions is customer service. It may sound trite, but I'm actually genuine about it.

I started a [new customer service blog][1] with a different approach. The blog will cover different situations where companies often make errors while handling customer service issues.

If you have suggestions for a post, please [let me know][2]!
