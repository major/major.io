In the summer of 2009, I had an idea. My workdays were spent deploying tons of
cloud infrastructure as Rackspace acquired Slicehost and we rushed to keep up
with the constant demands for new infrastructure from our customers. Working
quickly led to challenges with hardware and networking.

That was a time where the [I Can Has Cheeseburger] meme was red hot just about
everywhere. We needed a way to quickly check the public-facing IP address of
lots of backend infrastructure and our customers sometimes needed that
information, too.

That's when [icanhazip.com] was born.

It has always been simple site that returns your external IP address and nothing
else. No ads. No trackers. No goofy requirements. Sure, if you looked hard
enough, you could spot my attempt at jokes in the HTTP headers. Other than that,
the site had a narrow use case and started out mainly as an internal tool.

## That's when things got a little crazy

[Lifehacker's Australian site] featured a post about icanhazip.com and traffic
went through the roof. My little Slicehost instance was inundated and I quickly
realized my Apache and Python setup was not going to work long term.

I migrated to nginx and set up nginx to answer the requests by itself and
removed the Python scripts. The load on my small cloud instances came down
quickly and I figured the issue would be resolved for a while.

Fast forward to 2015 and icanhazip.com was serving well over 100M requests per
day. My cloud instances were getting crushed again, so I deployed more with
round robin DNS. _(My budget for icanhazip is tiny.)_ Once that was overloaded,
I moved to Hetzner in Germany since I could get physical servers there with
better network cards along with unlimited traffic.

The Hetzner servers were not expensive, but I was paying almost $200/month to
keep the site afloat and the site made no money. I met some people who worked
for Packet.net (now Equinix Metal) and they offered to sponsor the site. This
brought my expenses down a lot and I deployed icanhazip.com on one server at
Packet.

The site soon crossed 500M requests per day and I deployed a second server.
Traffic was still overloading the servers. I didn't want to spin up more servers
at Packet since they were already helping me out quite a bit, so I decided to
look under the hood of the kernel and make some improvements.

I learned more than I ever wanted to know about TCP backlogs, TCP/VLAN
offloading, packet coalescing, IRQ balancing, and a hundred other things. Some
Red Hat network experts helped me (before I joined the company) to continue
tweaking. The site was running well after that and I was thankful for the
support.

## Even crazier still

Soon the site exceeded 1B requests per day. I went back to the people who helped
me at Red Hat and after they looked through everything I sent, their response
was similar to the well-known line from Jaws: _"You're gonna need a bigger
boat."_

I languished on Twitter about how things were getting out of control and someone
from Cloudflare reached out to help. We configured Cloudflare to filter traffic
in front of the site and this reduced the impact from SYN floods, half-open TLS
connections, and other malicious clients that I couldn't even see when I hosted
the site on my own.

Later, Cloudflare launched workers and my contact there said I should consider
it since my responses were fairly simple and the workers product would handle it
well. The cost for workers looked horrifying at my traffic levels, but the folks
at Cloudflare offered to run my workers for free. Their new product was getting
bucket loads of traffic and I was able to scale the site even further.

In 2021, the traffic I once received in a month started arriving in 24 hours.
The site went from 1B requests per day to 30-35B requests per day over a
weekend. Almost all of that traffic came from several network blocks in China.
Through all of this, Cloudflare's workers kept chugging along and my response
times barely moved. I was grateful for the help.

Cloudflare was doing a lot for me and I wanted to curb some of the malicious
traffic to reduce the load on their products. I tried many times to reach out to
the email addresses on the Chinese ASNs and couldn't make contact with anyone.
Some former coworkers told me that my chances of changing that traffic or
getting a response to an abuse request was near zero.

## Malware almost ended everything

There was a phase for a few years where malware authors kept writing malware
that would call out to icanhazip.com to find out what they had infected. If they
could find out the external IP address of the systems they had compromised, they
could quickly assess the value of the target. Upatre was the first, but many
followed after that.

I received emails from companies, US state governments, and even US three letter
agencies (TLA). Most were very friendly and they had lots of questions. I explained how the site worked and rarely heard a lot more communication after that.

Not all of the interactions were positive, however. One CISO of a US state
emailed me and threatened all kinds of legal action claming that icanhazip.com
was involved in a malware infection in his state's computer systems. I tried
repeatedly to explain how the site worked and that the malware authors were
calling out to my site and I was powerless to stop it.

Along the way, many of my hosting providers received abuse emails about the
site. I was using a colocation provider in Dallas for a while and the tech
called me about an abuse email:

> "So we got another abuse email for you," they said.
>
> "For icanhazip.com?"
>
> "Yes. I didn't know that was running here, I use it all the time!"
>
> "Thanks! What do we do?"
>
> "Your site just returns IP addresses, right?"
>
> "Yes, that's it."
>
> "You know what, I'll write up a generic response and just start replying to
> these idiots for you from now on."

There were many times where I saw a big traffic jump and I realized the traffic
was coming from the same ASN, and likely from the same company. I tried reaching
out to these companies when I saw it but they rarely ever replied. Some even
became extremely hostile to my emails.

The passion left in my passion project started shrinking by the day.

## The fun totally dried up

Seeing that over 90% of my traffic load was malicious and abusive was
frustrating. Dealing with the abuse emails and complaints was worse.

I built the site originally as just a utility for my team to use, but then it
grew and it was fun to find new ways to handle the load without increasing cost.
Seeing 2 petabytes of data flowing out per month and knowing that almost all of
it was garbage pushed me over the line. I knew I needed a change.

I received a few small offers from various small companies ($5,000 or less), but
I realized that the money wasn't what I was after. I wanted someone to run the
site and help the information security industry to stop some of these malicious
actors.

## icanhazip.com lives on at Cloudflare

I've worked closely with my contacts at Cloudflare for a long time and they've
always jumped in to help me when something wasn't working well. Their
sponsorship or icanhazip.com has saved me tens of thousands of dollars per
month. It has also managed to keep the site alive even under horrific traffic
load.

I made this decision because Cloudflare has always done right by me and they've
pledged not only to keep the site running, but to work through the traffic load
and determine how to stop the malicious traffic. Their coordinated work with
other companies to stop compromised machines from degrading the performance of
so many sites was a great selling point for me.

If you're curious, Cloudflare did pay me for the site. We made a deal for them
to pay me $8.03; the cost of the domain registration. The goal was never to make
money from the site (although I did get about $75 in total donations from 2009 to
2021). The goal was to provide a service to the internet. Cloudflare has helped
me do that and they will continue to do it as the new owners and operators of
icanhazip.com.

## Gratitude

I'd like to thank everyone who has helped me with icanhazip.com along the way.
Tons of people stepped up to help with hosting and server optimization. Hosting
providers helped me field an onslaught of abuse requests and DDoS attacks. Most
of all, thanks to the people who used the site and helped to promote it.
