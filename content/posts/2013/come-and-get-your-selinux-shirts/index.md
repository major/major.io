title: Come and get your SELinux shirts!
---

After my [podcast interview][1] at the 2013 Red Hat Summit, Dan Walsh posted a photo of himself in the SELinux shirt that I gave him at the Summit:

    <a href="https://twitter.com/majorhayden">@majorhayden</a> thanks for the shirt. Big hit <a href="https://twitter.com/redhat">@redhat</a> office. <a href="http://t.co/Xf06Q39asi">pic.twitter.com/Xf06Q39asi</a>

Needless to say, I was flooded with requests for shirts after that. Someone suggested using the [Overpass font][2] and I have [new shirts ready for purchase][3] on Spreadshirt.

I set all the prices as low as the vendor will allow and I'm not making any profit for each purchase. I've seen over 20 orders come through already. There are two options for men and women so you can opt for a cheaper shirt or a higher quality one. You can even customize the color of the shirt!

[Go buy a few!][3]
