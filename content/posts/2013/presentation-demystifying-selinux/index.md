title: 'Presentation: Demystifying SELinux'
---

While rolling through my RSS feeds, I found a great presentation by David Quigley titled "Demystifying SELinux". He makes come good comparisons between discretionary/mandatory access controls and dives into what makes SELinux useful. Basic troubleshooting commands are covered within the presentation as well.

You can find the presentation over on [Speaker Deck][1]. I've also mirrored a [PDF copy][2] here on the site.

**UPDATE:** If you're going to [OSCON 2013][3] this year, it appears that [David][4] will be [presenting this topic][5] during the event.
