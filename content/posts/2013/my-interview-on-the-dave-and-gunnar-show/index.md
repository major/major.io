title: My interview on the Dave and Gunnar Show
---

[David Egts][1] and [Gunnar Hellekson][2] were kind enough to invite me to participate in their [Dave and Gunnar Show podcast][3] during the [2013 Red Hat Summit][4]. We talked about Red Hat Enterprise Linux and my takeaways from the Summit.

The [podcast episode][5] [32MB] is about 34 minutes long and my interview starts after the 21 minute mark. I'm always nervous when I do these things so you're certainly not allowed to poke fun at my accent. ;)
