title: drbd 8.4.2 for Fedora 18
---

![1]

If you use [DRBD][2] on Fedora 18, there's a [new client tools package][3] on its way to the stable repositories. The kernel module for DRBD was bumped to 8.4.2 and the client tools have been updated to match it.

This [fixes a bug][4] that was submitted earlier this month.
