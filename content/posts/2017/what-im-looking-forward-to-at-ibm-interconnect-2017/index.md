title: What I’m looking forward to at IBM Interconnect 2017
---

![1]

IBM Interconnect 2017 is coming up next month in Las Vegas. Last year's
conference was a whirlwind of useful talks, inspiring hallway conversations,
and great networking opportunities. I was exhausted by the week's end, but it
was totally worth it.

One of my favorite sessions from last year was [Tanmay Bakshi's][3] keynote.
It was truly inspiring to see someone so young take command of such a large
stage and teach us all something. I can't wait to hear another of his talks.

## Open Technology Summit (OTS)

This year, I'm interested to see the talks at the Open Technology Summit. It's
essentially a group of lightning talks from industry experts on a variety of
topics. This year's agenda has talks on OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, Blockchain,
and others. Although the event is three hours long, it feels a lot shorter
than that since each talk is anywhere from 10-20 minutes long.

The OTS starts on Sunday afternoon, so be sure to arrive in Las Vegas early
enough to attend.

## Security

Information security is always an interesting topic and I have my eye on the
following sessions:

  * Watson & Cyber Security: Bringing AI to the Battle _(it should be
    interesting to hear how machine learning can change the game)_
  * Transforming Security Organizations: Case Studies and Lessons Learned]
    _(I'm always interested in new ways to improve security outside of the
    systems themselves)_
  * Turning Traffic Lights Green: Defense and National Security in Cyberspace

## IT Transformation

  * The Austin Convention Center Gets Agile in the Cloud][8] _(hearing the
    'how' and 'why' about customers moving into cloud is valuable)_

## Open Source

  * Working in Open Communities is the Next Differentiator for Your Solution
    _(Walmart has done a lot in this space and I'm eager to learn more)_
  * Linux on the Mainframe: Linux Foundation and the Open Mainframe Project
  * Open Cloud Demystified: Open Source Leaders Tell All

I hope to see you there!
