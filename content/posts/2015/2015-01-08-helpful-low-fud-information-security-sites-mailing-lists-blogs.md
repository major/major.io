Keeping current with the latest trends and technologies in the realm of information security is critical and there are many options to choose from. However, as with any content on the internet, it takes some effort to find sites with a good signal-to-noise ratio. Information security is a heavily [FUD][2]-laden industry and I've taken some time to compile a list of helpful sites.

### General sites

* Cryptanalys.is: <https://cryptanalys.is/>
* Linux Weekly News _(subscription optional but highly recommended)_: <http://lwn.net/>
* Reddit's r/netsec: <https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec>
* SANS Internet Storm Center: <https://isc.sans.edu/>
* Wired: Threat Level: <http://www.wired.com/category/threatlevel/>

### Blogs

* Andy Ellis' Blog (CSO @ Akamai): <https://blogs.akamai.com/author/andy-ellis/>
* Bruce Schneier's Blog: <https://www.schneier.com/>
* Imperial Violet (good SSL/crypto knowledge): <https://www.imperialviolet.org/>
* Network Security Blog: <http://www.mckeay.net/>
* Red Hat's Security Blog: <https://securityblog.redhat.com/>
* TaoSecurity: <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/>

### Mailing Lists

* Apple Product Security ML: <https://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/security-announce/>
* Full Disclosure List: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/>

### Humor (come on, we need it)

* Security Reactions _(occasionally NSFW)_: <http://securityreactions.tumblr.com/>
* DNS Reactions _(also occasionally NSFW)_: <http://dnsreactions.tumblr.com/>

Many thanks to my [coworkers][3] for helping to compile the list. If you have any others that you really enjoy, let me know! I'll be glad to add them to the post.
