title: Slides from my Texas Linux Fest 2015 talk
---

Thanks to all of the people who attended my "Be an inspiration, not an impostor" talk at Texas Linux Fest 2015. Some A/V issues caused my time slot to get squeezed and the audience had to put up with the "ludicrous speed" version of the presentation.

The slides are a little different from the slides at [Fedora Flock][2], but they're mainly the same:
