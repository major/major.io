Emojis brighten up any message or document. They also serve as excellent methods
for testing whether your application handles strings appropriately. _(This can
be a lot of fun.)_ ü§≠

I constantly obsess with efficiency and shortening the time and effort required
to get my work done. I noticed that I could type short text emoticons like _:)_
and _;)_ so much faster than I could use emojis. This simply would not do. üòâ

## First attempts

[Emoji Copy] was my first try at getting the emojis I needed quickly. The site
also offers a native emoji mode which allows you to see if your system is
handling emojis correctly. The site loads quickly and the search find emojis in
a flash, but it was annoying to open a browser tab just to find an emoji. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The GNOME Extension called [Emoji Selector] made the selection process faster,
but I moved from GNOME to i3 and lost my GNOME extensions. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Other methods, such as the [Emoji input method] and the [ibus-typing-booster],
also worked, but I knew there had to be something more efficient than those. ü§î

[Emoji Copy]: https://www.emojicopy.com/
[Emoji Selector]: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1162/emoji-selector/
[Emoji input method]: https://fedoramagazine.org/boost-typing-emoji-fedora-28-workstation/
[ibus-typing-booster]: https://mike-fabian.github.io/ibus-typing-booster/

## Enter rofimoji

The [rofi] launcher quickly become part of my core workflow in i3 (replacing
[dmenu]) and I was pleasantly surprised to find [rofimoji] in GitHub. ü§ó

The rofimoji launcher follows in rofi's footsteps and gives you quick access to
emojis. Using rofimoji is easy:

1. Bind a key combination to run `rofimoji` _(I use Mod+E)_
2. Type in a search term to find the perfect emoji
3. Press enter to input it directly in the active window or shift+enter to copy
   it to the clipboard
4. üéâ

Depending on the application you're using, you might need to mess around with
roflmoji's `--action` parameter. Some applications will take the emoji directly
as if you typed it from a keyboard, but most of the ones I use seem to like a
copy/paste method via the clipboard. üìã

I use the `--action clipboard` parameter and it works well across browsers and
terminals. Here's the line from the i3 configuration file:

```text
bindsym $mod+e exec --no-startup-id rofimoji --skin-tone light --action clipboard --rofi-args='-theme solarized -font "hack 12" -width 800'
```

## RPMs for Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL

At the moment, rofimoji is not packaged for Fedora, CentOS, or Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL). However, you can install it from my [COPR packages
repository]:

```text
sudo dnf copr enable mhayden/packages
sudo dnf install python3-rofimoji
```

Enjoy! üç∞
