title: Upgraded to WordPress 2.6.2
---

I've updated the blog to WordPress 2.6.2 tonight. There are some [relatively serious security concerns][1] with some of the code in WordPress 2.6.1, so I'd recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience.

Slide on over to the [WordPress][2] site and [download it now][3].
