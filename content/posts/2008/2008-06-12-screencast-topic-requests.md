I've received some great feedback on my first [screencast][1]. The suggestions have been helpful, and the compliments have made me want to create more free screencasts.

At this point, I'm opening it up to you - what would you like to learn? Of course, I'm still planning to make a full set of screencasts for the MySQL DBA certification, but that will come later.
