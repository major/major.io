One of the topics I receive the most questions about is MySQL replication. In a series of posts, I'll explore these questions in-depth each day. If you have any extra questions that I don't happen to answer, throw me a comment and I'll be happy to review it for you.

The topics will cover MySQL 4.1 and 5.0, but I'll leave out [MySQL 5.1's new replication abilities][1] since it has not reached a General Availability status quite yet.
