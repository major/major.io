title: Listing of VMWare configuration parameters
---

For a recent project, I needed to automatically provision VM's for testing. I wanted to make the .vmx files on the fly with the exact configuration required, but I couldn't find documentation for the options that are allowed in the .vmx files. Luckily, a fellow named Ulli Hankeln has [made an impressive list][1] available on his site.

The listings contain tons of options that I wasn't aware of, and it also provides hints on which ones you shouldn't adjust.
