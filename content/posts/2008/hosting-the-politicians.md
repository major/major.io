title: Hosting the politicians
---

Call me weird - but I like to know where people host their sites. When I get a link to a nice-looking site, I'll get there and think, "Hmm, I wonder where they host."

Part of this curiosity probably stems from being a server administrator. I've used seven different dedicated server providers before along with 5 different VPS providers. There's quite a few shared hosters thrown into the mix as well. I like to know which companies that people use when they have a site that is tremendously vital to their everyday lives.

Without further ado, here's some of the politicians' hosters that I've found (in alphabetical order):

**Bob Barr** - _Rackspace_ (67.192.188.81)

**Hillary Clinton** - _Rackspace_ (72.32.103.48)

**John Edwards** - _Internap_ (70.42.42.155)

**Rudy Giuliani** - _Core NAP_ (64.20.231.77)

**Mike Gravel** - _Media Temple_ (64.13.237.176)

**Mike Huckabee** - _HostMySite_ (208.112.83.62)

**Alan Keyes** - _ThePlanet_ (74.52.145.91)

**John McCain** - _Smartech Corporation_ (64.203.107.147)

**Ralph Nader** - _FutureQuest_ (69.5.9.21)

**Barack Obama** - _Pair Networks_ (66.39.143.229)

**Ron Paul** - _Rackspace_ (74.205.22.51)

**Bill Richardson** - _Engine Yard_ (65.74.179.43)

**Mitt Romney** - _Rackspace_ (72.32.175.83)
