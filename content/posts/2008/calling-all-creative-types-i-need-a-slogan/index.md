title: 'Calling all creative types: I need a slogan'
---

As some of you may know, MySQLTuner is one of my favorite projects. It's approaching the 1.0 release and I feel like celebrating. I thought about putting together some T-shirts (because as a nerd, I enjoy the occasional techy T-shirt), but I can't come up with a good slogan.

I've heard of some pretty hilarious slogans for database-related activities, like "DBA's know how to take dumps" and "don't overflow my buffer", but I'm trying to come up with some good ones for MySQLTuner. Whoever picks the slogan/joke that wins and goes on the shirt will get a free shirt from me. Yes, I did say **free**.
