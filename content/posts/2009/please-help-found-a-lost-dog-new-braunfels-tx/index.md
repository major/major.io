title: Please help! Found a lost dog â€“ New Braunfels, TX
---

**Update**: The dog has made it back home to its family. Thanks to all that helped spread the word!

This is not the usual type of post I'd make on this blog, but I'm trying to find a home for a lost dog that my wife found in New Braunfels, TX. More details are on my [Posterous blog][1].
