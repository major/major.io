I've upgraded the blog to WordPress 2.8.6 after I read about the [registered user exploits][1].

Also, I've dropped the [Adsimple][2] theme I was using, and I'm now using a slightly modified [Dojo][3] theme. It's a little easier on the eyes, but it's still lightweight enough to be fast on mobile broadband connections.

Let me know what you think!
