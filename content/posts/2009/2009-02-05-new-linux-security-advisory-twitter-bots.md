Thanks to the simplicity of [ruby][1] as well as the [twitter][2] and [httparty][3] gems, I've whipped up some Twitter bots today. The three bots will alert you when there are Red Hat, Ubuntu, or Debian security advisories. I'd set one up for Fedora, but their feed is broken today.

**[@redhaterrata][4]** - Red Hat Errata Updates

**[@ubuntusecurity][5]** - Ubuntu Security Notifications

**[@debiansecurity][6]** - Debian Security Advisories

As always, you can [let me know][7] if you have any suggestions for improvements, or other bots you'd like to see.
