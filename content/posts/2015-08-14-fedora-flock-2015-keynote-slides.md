[Fedora Flock 2015][1] is still going here in Rochester, New York, and I kicked off our second day [with a keynote talk][2] about overcoming [impostor syndrome][3].

If you'd like to review the slides, [they're on SlideShare][4]:

Quite a few people came up after the talk and throughout the day to share some of their stories and challenges. It was extremely rewarding to have those conversations and share solutions.

I'll be doing the talk once more at Texas Linux Fest in San Marcos on August 22.
