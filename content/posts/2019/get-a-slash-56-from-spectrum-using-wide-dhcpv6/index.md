title: Get a /56 from Spectrum using wide-dhcpv6
---

After writing my [last post] on my IPv6 woes with my Pixel 3, some readers
asked how I'm handling IPv6 on my router lately. I [wrote about this
previously] when Spectrum was Time Warner Cable and I was using Mikrotik
network devices.

There is a good post from 2015 on the blog and it still works today:

* [Time Warner Road Runner, Linux, and large IPv6 subnets]

I am still using that same setup today, but some readers found it difficult
to find the post since Time Warner Cable has renamed to Spectrum. Don't worry
-- the old post still works. :)
