The abrupt change from &ldquo;top dog at the startup&rdquo; to &ldquo;wow, I don&rsquo;t know anything about Linux&rdquo; caught me by surprise and I was trying to stuff as much knowledge into my brain as quickly as I could. My teammates at Rackspace were eager to show me the ropes of wrangling servers and supporting customers.</p><p>As I mentioned already, the blog started out just as a place to stuff my notes from the things I learned at work. I figured that it would be nice to store it in a searchable format but it would also be great if I could link other people to certain posts if they needed more information to fix a problem. It was a way to retain knowledge but yet give it back to the people around me who needed it.</p><p>The blog has hit 456 posts (this one is #457) and it&rsquo;s gone from a few page views per day to just over 20,000 per day. Here are the top five most accessed posts (since I&rsquo;ve been keeping stats):</p><ol><li><a href=../../../../2008/11/02/syncing-an-iphone-with-a-new-mac-without-hassles/>Syncing an iPhone with a new Mac without hassles</a></li><li><a href=../../../../2008/01/24/ip_conntrack-table-full-dropping-packet/>ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet</a></li><li><a href=../../../../2007/02/09/delete-single-iptables-rules/>Delete a single iptables rule</a></li><li><a href=../../../../2007/01/24/increase-mysql-connection-limit/>Increase MySQL connection limit</a></li><li><a href=../../../../2008/06/24/mysql-error-1040-too-many-connections/>MySQL Error 1040: too many connections</a></li></ol><p>I&rsquo;d like to send out a big thanks to the people who read this blog, add comments (or complaints!), and suggest new topics. You are the reason why I take the time to keep this blog going.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/blog/>#blog</a>
