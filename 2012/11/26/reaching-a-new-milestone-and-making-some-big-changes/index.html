<content><p><strong>This is my 500th post on this blog!</strong> I&rsquo;m really grateful for the constant comments, questions, and even the complaints (really!) that I receive about the topics discussed here throughout the years. The sole reason I keep this blog going is for the readers and I hope you&rsquo;re able to get value out of it over time. (If you don&rsquo;t, be sure to let me know so I can make some changes.)</p><p>With that said, the best segue I can find for the rest of this post is this quote that I first heard when I was a kid:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.&rdquo; - Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ll reach my six year Rackspace anniversary in December and I&rsquo;ve spent just shy of the last four years working on Rackspace&rsquo;s cloud virtualization products. It started shortly after the Slicehost acquisition and I was on teams that helped to expand Slicehost, created Cloud Servers, and most recently, launched a new Cloud Servers infrastructure powered by OpenStack. Being able to participate in these big changes and work alongside some of the best technical folks (and friends) has been an amazing experience and I&rsquo;m extremely lucky to be a small part of what we&rsquo;ve made.</p><p>Walking away from that challenging work and those amazing people isn&rsquo;t easy. However, I&rsquo;m going to give it a try.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve accepted a position as Rackspace&rsquo;s Chief Security Architect and I&rsquo;m transitioning into that position over the next few weeks. There are quite a few familiar faces in this part of the business at Rackspace and I have a strong team of knowledgeable security architects to lead. It certainly won&rsquo;t be an easy road to travel but I&rsquo;m glad to have the opportunity to make a difference along with my team. Also, my team is expanding and <a href=http://jobs.rackspace.com/job/San-Antonio-Senior-Security-Architect-US-Job-TX-78201/2223051/>we&rsquo;re in need of some talented people</a>!</p><p>Some of the topics on this blog might change a little but please don&rsquo;t worry: I&rsquo;m still a Linux nerd at heart.</p><p>The other big change is that <a href=http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel-announce/2012-November/000993.html>I&rsquo;ve been appointed</a> to the <a href=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board>Fedora Board</a>. I&rsquo;ve been a long time Fedora user (since Core 2 in 2004) and I&rsquo;m eager to continue some of the great work that has been done in the past. I&rsquo;m also a new Fedora Ambassador and I&rsquo;ll be glad to help you get started or get more out of Fedora if you need a hand.</p><p>If you follow OpenStack closely and you enjoy using <a href=http://rackerhacker.github.com/supernova/>supernova</a>, I&rsquo;ll still be maintaining that project since I still use OpenStack clouds regularly.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/blog/>#blog</a>
