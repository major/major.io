Some commits destined for a branch called development ended up in master. To make matters worse, development was rebased on top of master and the history was obviously mangled.</p><p>My goal was to find out which commits existed in development but didn&rsquo;t exist anywhere in master. From there, I needed to find out which commits existed in master that didn&rsquo;t exist in development. That would give me all of the commits that needed to be in the development branch.</p><p>I constructed this awful looking bash mess to figure out which commits were in development but not in master:</p><p>I had a list of commits that existed in development but not in master:</p><pre><code>965cf71 Trollface
acda854 Some patch 2
bf1f3e2 Some patch 1
db1980c Packaging
</code></pre><p>From there, I could swap <code>MASTER</code> and <code>DEV</code> to figure out which commits existed in master but not in development. Only a couple of commits showed up and these were the ones which were committed and pushed to master inadvertently. After a couple of careful cherry picks and reversions, my branches were back to normal.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/bash/>#bash</a>
