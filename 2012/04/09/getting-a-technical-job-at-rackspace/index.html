Part of the slowdown is due to an uptick in work required to get <a href=http://www.openstack.org/>OpenStack</a> <a href=http://nova.openstack.org/>Nova</a> and its related software up and running at <a href=http://rackspace.com/>Rackspace</a> for <a href=http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/>Cloud Servers</a> and another part of it is a severe case of writer&rsquo;s block. I threw out some questions on Twitter about the topics people would like to see covered in some new posts and a commonly requested topic was employment at Rackspace.</p><p><img src=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/boromir_rackspace_job.jpg alt=5></p><p><em>First things first, getting a job at Rackspace isn&rsquo;t easy.</em> We don&rsquo;t <em>intentionally</em> make the process difficult. It&rsquo;s just that the work we do is unique and demanding.</p><p>We work in a fast-paced, extremely dynamic team-centric environment. While some people in the company work in extremely small teams or sometimes all by themselves, that&rsquo;s pretty few and far between. We look for people who can survive and flourish in this atmosphere and we look for people who can do it all while working as a team. Even with all of this hustle and bustle, we still remember why we&rsquo;re doing it: <strong>the pursuit of Fanatical Support for our customers</strong>.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that there&rsquo;s no true secret for making it through the application process. There&rsquo;s no magic combination of skills or &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; that will scoot you through. Every candidate is reviewed individually for each position. There have been several times at the end of an interview where we&rsquo;ve gotten together and said: &ldquo;Wow, this candidate is solid, but they&rsquo;re just not right for this position. Let&rsquo;s find the right spot and see if there&rsquo;s a spot open.&rdquo; We look for the right candidate for the right position at the right time.</p><p>One of the best ways to get ahead in the screening or interview process is to do a little homework about Rackspace and the products we offer. Much of this is covered in a <a href=../../../../2011/05/02/do-your-homework-before-a-technical-interview/>post I wrote in 2011</a>. You&rsquo;ll go into the interviews with more confidence and it will be much more obvious that you&rsquo;re really interested in the position.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t be discouraged if the process takes a little longer than you expected. When I was hired in 2006, I went through two phone pre-screens and then three back-to-back interviews in person. Things have changed a little since then and I&rsquo;ve heard of some candidates receiving two to three pre-screens via telephone and then one or two interviews in person. The additional screening and interviews may be due to Rackers trying to find the right fit for a particular applicant. As I said previously, we look for the right fit for each applicant. We may consider you for a different position than you applied for if we feel like your skill set or personality fits that role better.</p><p>A very common question is what to wear to a Rackspace interview. It&rsquo;s confusing to know exactly what&rsquo;s expected since we have Rackers in the building wearing everything from suits to flip-flops. This is where you really have to go with your gut. Interviewing for a customer-facing sales position while wearing a hoodie and shorts is probably going to bring a suboptimal result. Keep in mind that there&rsquo;s really nothing negative about overdressing (but keep your tuxedo in the closet, seriously). I wore a shirt and tie for my interviews in 2006 but my tie got caught in the car door and was shredded. After a lot of cursing, I took off the tie and decided to wing it with my dress shirt. Nobody ever said a word about it.</p><p>Remember to be flexible during the interviews. You might be asked to draw a solution on a whiteboard or think through a really complicated situation. Roll with it and keep your confidence up. When you don&rsquo;t know something, admit it, but then talk about how you&rsquo;d research an answer.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one last thing to keep in mind and it&rsquo;s really critical. If you&rsquo;re ever asked about how you would solve a problem or how you solved a problem in the past, <strong>don&rsquo;t divulge any information which is confidential or proprietary to your current company</strong>. Just tell the interviewers that you&rsquo;ve solved the solution in the past but you&rsquo;ll need to keep things vague to maintain confidentiality. We will definitely understand and we will encourage you to maintain that confidentiality.</p><p>Leave your comments if you have any! I&rsquo;ll be glad to answer any questions you have.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://major.io/tags/general-advice/>general advice</a></span>
