<content><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/OpenStack-Logo-Horizontal-e1491414195297.png></a>DISA&rsquo;s final release of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) <a href=https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/>came out a few weeks ago</a> and it has plenty of improvements and changes. The openstack-ansible-security role has already been updated with these changes.</p><p>Quite a few duplicated STIG controls were removed and a few new ones were added. Some of the controls in the pre-release were difficult to implement, especially those that changed parameters for PKI-based authentication.</p><p>The biggest challenge overall was the renumbering. The pre-release STIG used an unusual numbering convention: RHEL-07-123456. The final version used the more standardized &ldquo;V&rdquo; numbers, such as V-72225. This change required a <a href=https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-security/commit/dccce1d5cc06985a58f0ecba4fd0d977388592b2>substantial patch</a> to bring the Ansible role inline with the new STIG release.</p><p>All of the <a href=https://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/controls-rhel7.html>role&rsquo;s documentation</a> is now updated to reflect the new numbering scheme and STIG changes. The key thing to remember is that you&rsquo;ll need to use <code>--skip-tag</code> with the new STIG numbers if you need to skip certain tasks.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These changes won&rsquo;t be backported to the <code>stable/ocata</code> branch, so you need to use the <code>master</code> branch to get these changes.</p><p>Have feedback?
