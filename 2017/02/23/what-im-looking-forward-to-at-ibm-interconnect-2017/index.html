conference was a whirlwind of useful talks, inspiring hallway conversations,
and great networking opportunities. I was exhausted by the week&rsquo;s end, but it
was totally worth it.</p><p>One of my favorite sessions from last year was <a href=https://twitter.com/tajymany>Tanmay Bakshi&rsquo;s</a> keynote.
It was truly inspiring to see someone so young take command of such a large
stage and teach us all something. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear another of his talks.</p><h2 id=open-technology-summit-ots>Open Technology Summit (OTS)</h2><p>This year, I&rsquo;m interested to see the talks at the Open Technology Summit. It&rsquo;s
essentially a group of lightning talks from industry experts on a variety of
topics. This year&rsquo;s agenda has talks on OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, Blockchain,
and others. Although the event is three hours long, it feels a lot shorter
than that since each talk is anywhere from 10-20 minutes long.</p><p>The OTS starts on Sunday afternoon, so be sure to arrive in Las Vegas early
enough to attend.</p><h2 id=security>Security</h2><p>Information security is always an interesting topic and I have my eye on the
following sessions:</p><ul><li>Watson & Cyber Security: Bringing AI to the Battle <em>(it should be
interesting to hear how machine learning can change the game)</em></li><li>Transforming Security Organizations: Case Studies and Lessons Learned]
<em>(I&rsquo;m always interested in new ways to improve security outside of the
systems themselves)</em></li><li>Turning Traffic Lights Green: Defense and National Security in Cyberspace</li></ul><h2 id=it-transformation>IT Transformation</h2><ul><li>The Austin Convention Center Gets Agile in the Cloud][8] <em>(hearing the
&lsquo;how&rsquo; and &lsquo;why&rsquo; about customers moving into cloud is valuable)</em></li></ul><h2 id=open-source>Open Source</h2><ul><li>Working in Open Communities is the Next Differentiator for Your Solution
<em>(Walmart has done a lot in this space and I&rsquo;m eager to learn more)</em></li><li>Linux on the Mainframe: Linux Foundation and the Open Mainframe Project</li><li>Open Cloud Demystified: Open Source Leaders Tell All</li></ul><p>I hope to see you there!</p><p><em>Photo credit: By Ronnie Macdonald from Chelmsford, United Kingdom (Mandalay
