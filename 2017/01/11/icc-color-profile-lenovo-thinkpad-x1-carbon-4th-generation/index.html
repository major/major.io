The default <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile>ICC profile</a> in GNOME didn&rsquo;t help much.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a <a href=http://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-2016-Core-i7-WQHD-Ultrabook-Review.162631.0.html>helpful review over at NotebookCheck</a> that has a link to an <a href=http://www.notebookcheck.net/uploads/tx_nbc2/X1_Carbon_WQHD_VVX14T058J00.icm>ICC profile generated</a> from a 4th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon. This profile was marginally better than GNOME&rsquo;s default, but it still looked a bit more washed out than what it should be.</p><p>I picked up a <a href=http://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colormunki-display>ColorMunki Display</a> and went through a fast calibration in <a href=https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/3.14/color.html.en>GNOME&rsquo;s Color Manager</a>. The low quality run finished in under 10 minutes and the improvement was definitely noticeable. Colors look much deeper and less washed out. The display looks <em>very</em> similar to the previous generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/fedora/>#fedora</a>
