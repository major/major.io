Many people still feel like there&rsquo;s no audience out there for the things they write. Just remember that someone, somewhere, can learn something from you and from your experiences. Write from the heart about what interests you and the readers will gradually appear. It&rsquo;s a <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/>Field of Dreams</a> moment.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who has given me support over the years to keep the writing going!</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/blog/>#blog</a>
