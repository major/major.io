<content><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/fedorainfinity.png></a>Most of the recent Fedora upgrades have been quite smooth. There were definitely some rough spots back in Fedora 15 and Fedora 17 with the <code>/bin</code> migration and the switch to systemd. The upgrade from Fedora 23 to Fedora 24 has been really easy except for one minor quirk: my two and three finger taps don&rsquo;t seem to work on the touchpad.</p><p>I use a <a href=../../../../2015/03/30/review-lenovo-x1-carbon-3rd-generation-and-linux/>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (3rd gen)</a> and it has a clickpad along with physical buttons across the top. I use the two finger taps (to do a secondary click) frequently. After the Fedora 24 upgrade, I can still do <em>clicks</em> with one, two or three fingers, but the <em>taps</em> don&rsquo;t work.</p><p>After a little digging in <code>xinput</code>, I began to narrow down the problem:</p><pre><code>[major@arsenic ~]$ xinput list
âŽ¡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
âŽœ   â†³ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]

[major@arsenic ~]$ xinput list-props 11 | grep Tap
    Synaptics Tap Time (271):   180
    Synaptics Tap Move (272):   252
    Synaptics Tap Durations (273):  180, 100, 100
    Synaptics Tap Action (285): 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
</code></pre><h2 id=hunting-for-a-fix>Hunting for a fix</h2><p>It seems like this <code>Synaptics Tap Action (285)</code> is what I need to adjust. What do those numbers mean, anyway?</p><p>After some searching, I found the answer in some <a href=ftp://www.x.org/pub/X11R7.5/doc/man/man4/synaptics.4.html>Synaptics documentation</a>:</p><pre><code>Synaptics Tap Action
8 bit, up to MAX_TAP values (see synaptics.h), 0 disables an element. order: RT, RB, LT, LB, F1, F2, F3.
</code></pre><p>This seems like what I want, but what do those abbreviations mean at the end? I scrolled up on the page and found something useful:</p><pre><code>Option &quot;RTCornerButton&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a right top corner tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
Option &quot;RBCornerButton&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a right bottom corner tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
Option &quot;LTCornerButton&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a left top corner tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
Option &quot;LBCornerButton&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a left bottom corner tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
Option &quot;TapButton1&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a non-corner one-finger tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
Option &quot;TapButton2&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a non-corner two-finger tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
Option &quot;TapButton3&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Which mouse button is reported on a non-corner three-finger tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot;
</code></pre><p>The last three are the ones I care about. Then the abbreviations made sense:</p><ul><li>F1: TapButton1</li><li>F2: TapButton2</li><li>F3: TapButton3</li></ul><p>The <code>TapButton1</code> setting was already set to <em>1</em>, which means a primary tap. I need <code>TapButton2</code> set to <em>3</em> (two fingers for a secondary button tap) and <code>TapButton3</code> set to <em>2</em> (three fingers for a middle button tap). Let&rsquo;s try with <code>xinput</code> directly first:</p><pre><code>xinput set-prop 11 &quot;Synaptics Tap Action&quot; 0 0 0 0 1 3 2
</code></pre><p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong> The secondary and middle taps have returned!</p><h2 id=making-it-stick>Making it stick</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s make the setting permanent. You could add this to a <code>~/.xprofile</code> or some other file that the display manager runs, but this isn&rsquo;t helpful if you have a touchpad that could be removed or re-added (like a USB touchpad). For this, we need an extra X configuration file.</p><p>I created a file called <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-xinput-fix-multi-finger-taps.conf</code> and added some configuration:</p><pre><code>Section &quot;InputClass&quot;
       Identifier &quot;tap-by-default&quot;
       MatchIsTouchpad &quot;on&quot;
       Option &quot;TapButton1&quot; &quot;1&quot;
       Option &quot;TapButton2&quot; &quot;3&quot;
       Option &quot;TapButton3&quot; &quot;2&quot;
EndSection
</code></pre><p>The configuration file specifies what we want to occur when one, two or three fingers tap on the pad. We&rsquo;re also being careful here to match only on touchpads to avoid tinkering with a mouse or other pointer device.</p><p>Log out of your X session and log in again. Your two and three finger taps should still be working!</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/fedora/>#fedora</a>
