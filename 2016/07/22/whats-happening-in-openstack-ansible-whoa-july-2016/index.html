<content><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/openstack-justheo.png></a>This post is the second installment in the series of <a href=../../../../tags/whoa/>What&rsquo;s Happening in OpenStack-Ansible (WHOA)</a> posts that I&rsquo;m assembling each month. My goal is to inform more people about what we&rsquo;re doing in the OpenStack-Ansible community and bring on more contributors to the project.</p><p>July brought lots of changes for the OpenStack-Ansible project and the remaining work for the <a href=http://releases.openstack.org/newton/schedule.html>Newton release</a> is coming together well. Many of the changes made in the Newton branch have made deployments faster, more reliable and more repeatable.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get to the report!</p><h2 id=new-releases>New releases</h2><p>You can always find out about the newest releases for most OpenStack projects on the OpenStack Development mailing list, but I&rsquo;ll give you the shortest summary possible here.</p><h3 id=kilo>Kilo</h3><p>The final Kilo release, <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/336505/>11.2.17</a>, is in the books! If you&rsquo;re on Kilo, it&rsquo;s definitely time to move forward.</p><h3 id=liberty>Liberty</h3><p>The latest Liberty release is now <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/342310/>12.1.0</a>. For more information on what&rsquo;s included, review the <a href=http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/openstack-ansible/liberty.html>release notes</a> or view a <a href=https://gist.github.com/major/c965c67ae56d3a34a30b32d8212c258f>detailed changelog</a>.</p><h3 id=mitaka>Mitaka</h3><p>Mitaka is the latest stable branch and it&rsquo;s currently at version <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/342307/>13.2.0</a>. It contains lots of bug fixes and a few small backported features. The latest details are always in the <a href=http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/openstack-ansible/mitaka.html>release notes</a> and the <a href=https://gist.github.com/major/def75c576cd22c09b5e62fcc2d138202>detailed changelog</a>.</p><h2 id=notable-discussions>Notable discussions</h2><p>The OpenStack-Ansible mid-cycle is quickly approaching! It runs from August 10th through the 12th at Rackspace&rsquo;s headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. All of the signup information is on the <a href=https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/osa-midcycle-newton>etherpad</a> along with the proposed agenda. If you&rsquo;re interested in OpenStack deployment automation with Ansible, please feel free to join us!</p><p>Support for Open vSwitch is now in OpenStack-Ansible, along with Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR). Travis Truman wrote a <a href=http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-July/098858.html>blog post</a> about using the new Open vSwitch support. The support for DVR <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/338546/>was added</a> very recently.</p><p>We had a good discussion around standardizing how OpenStack&rsquo;s python services are deployed. Some projects are now recommending the use of uwsgi with their API services. During this week&rsquo;s IRC meeting, we agreed as a group that the best option would be to standardize on uwsgi if possible during the Newton release. If that&rsquo;s not possible, it should be done early in the Ocata release.</p><p>Jean-Philippe Evrard <a href=https://openstack.nimeyo.com/90118/openstack-openstack-nominating-philippe-openstack-openstack>was nominated to be a core developer</a> on OpenStack-Ansible and the thread received many positive comments over the week. Congratulations, JP!</p><h2 id=notable-developments>Notable developments</h2><p>Lots of work is underway in the Newton release to add support for new features, squash bugs, and reduce the time it takes to deploy a cloud.</p><h3 id=documentation>Documentation</h3><p>Documentation seems to go one of two ways with most projects:</p><ul><li>Sufficient documentation that is organized poorly (OpenStack-Ansible&rsquo;s current state)</li><li>Insufficient documentation that is organized well</li></ul><p>One of the complaints I heard at the summit was <strong><em>&ldquo;What the heck are we thinking with chapter four?"</em></strong></p><p>To be fair, <a href=http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/mitaka/install-guide/configure.html>that chapter</a> is gigantic. While it contains a myriad of useful information, advice, and configuration options, it&rsquo;s overwhelming for beginners and even seasoned deployers.</p><p>Work is underway to overhaul the installation guide and provide a simple, easy-to-follow, opinionated method for deploying an OpenStack cloud. This would allow beginners to start on solid ground and have a straightforward deployment guide. The additional information and configuration options would still be available in the documentation, but the documentation will provide strong recommendations for the best possible options.</p><h3 id=gnocchi-deployments>Gnocchi deployments</h3><p>OpenStack-Ansible can now deploy Gnocchi. Gnocchi provides a time series database as a service and it&rsquo;s handy for use with ceilometer, which stores a lot of time-based information.</p><h3 id=multiple-rabbitmq-clusters>Multiple RabbitMQ clusters</h3><p>Some OpenStack services communicate very frequently with RabbitMQ and that can cause issues for some other services. OpenStack-Ansible now supports independent RabbitMQ clusters for certain services. This allows a deployer to use a different RabbitMQ cluster for handling telemetry traffic than they use for handling nova&rsquo;s messages.</p><h3 id=powervm-support>PowerVM support</h3><p>Lots of changes were added to allow for multiple architecture support, which is required for full PowerVM support. Some additional fixes for higher I/O performance and OVS on Power support arrived as well.</p><h3 id=repo-server-improvements>Repo server improvements</h3><p>Building the repo server takes quite a bit of time as repositories are cloned, wheels are built, and virtual environments are assembled. A series of patches merged into the project that aim to reduce the time to build a repo server.</p><p>Previously, the repo server built every possible virtual environment that could be needed for an OpenStack-Ansible deployment. Today, the repo server only builds virtual environments for those services that will be deployed. This saves time during the build process and a fair amount of disk space as well.</p><p>Source code is also kept on the repo server so that it won&rsquo;t need to be downloaded again for multiple architecture builds.</p><p>Additional changes are on the way to only clone the necessary git repositories to the repo server.</p><h3 id=ubuntu-1604-xenial-support>Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) support</h3><p>Almost all of the OpenStack-Ansible roles in Newton have Ubuntu 16.04 support and the integrated gate job is turning green a lot more often this week. We still need some testers who can do some real world multi-server deployments and shake out any bugs that don&rsquo;t appear in an all-in-one (AIO) build.</p><h2 id=feedback>Feedback?</h2><p>The goal of this newsletter is three fold:</p><ul><li><p>Keep OpenStack-Ansible developers updated with new changes</p></li><li><p>Inform operators about new features, fixes, and long-term goals</p></li><li><p>Bring more people into the OpenStack-Ansible community to share their use</p><p>cases, bugs, and code</p></li></ul><p>Please let me know if you spot any errors, areas for improvement, or items that I missed altogether. I&rsquo;m <code>mhayden</code> on Freenode IRC and you can find me on <a href=https://twitter.com/majorhayden>Twitter</a> anytime.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/ansible/>#ansible</a>
