<content><p><img src=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Holistic-Security-for-OpenStack-Clouds-OpenStack-Summit-Barcelona-2.png alt=1></p><p>Thanks to everyone who attended my talk at the OpenStack Summit in Barcelona! I really enjoyed sharing some tips with the audience and it was great to meet some attendees in person afterwards.</p><p>If you weren&rsquo;t able to make it, don&rsquo;t fret! This post will cover some of the main points of the talk and link to the video and slides.</p><h2 id=purpose>Purpose</h2><p>OpenStack clouds are inherently complex. Operating a cloud involves a lot of moving pieces in software, hardware, and networking. Securing complex systems can be a real challenge, especially for newcomers to the information security realm. One wrong turn can knock critical infrastructure online or lead to lengthy debugging sessions.</p><p>However, securing OpenStack clouds doesn&rsquo;t need to be a tremendously stressful experience. It requires a methodical, thoughful, and strategic approach. The goal of the talk is give the audience a reliable strategy that is easy to start with and that scales easily over time.</p><h2 id=why-holistic>Why holistic?</h2><p>The dictionary definition of <em>holistic</em> is:</p><blockquote><p>characterized by comprehension of the parts of something as intimately connected and explicable only by reference to the whole</p></blockquote><p>To simplify things a bit, thinking about something holistically means that you understand that there are small parts that are valuable on their own, but they make much more value when combined together. Also, it&rsquo;s difficult to talk about the individual parts and get a real understanding of the whole.</p><p>In holistic medicine, humans are considered to be a body, mind, and spirit. OpenStack clouds involve servers, software, and a business goal. Security consists of people, process, and technology. To truly understand what&rsquo;s going on, you need to take a look at something with all of its parts connected.</p><h2 id=security-refresher>Security refresher</h2><p>Get into the mindset that <strong>attackers will get in eventually</strong>. Just change each instance of <em>if</em> to <em>when</em> in your conversations. Attackers can be wrong many times, but the defenders only need to be wrong once to allow a breach to occur.</p><p>Simply building a huge moat and tall castle walls around the outside isn&rsquo;t sufficient. Attackers will have free reign to move around inside and take what they want. Multiple layers are needed, and this is the backbone of a <em>defense-in-depth</em> strategy.</p><p>Cloud operators need to work from the outside inwards, much like you do with utensils at a fancy dinner. Make a good wall around the outside and work on tightening down the internals at multiple levels.</p><h2 id=four-layers-for-openstack>Four layers for OpenStack</h2><p>During the talk, I divided OpenStack clouds into four main layers:</p><ul><li>outer perimeter</li><li>control and data planes</li><li>OpenStack services and backend services in the control plane</li><li>OpenStack services</li></ul><p>For the best explanation of what to do at this level, I highly recommend reviewing the slides or the presentation video (keep scrolling).</p><h2 id=links-and-downloads>Links and downloads</h2><p>The slides are on <a href=http://www.slideshare.net/MajorHayden/holistic-security-for-openstack-clouds>SlideShare</a> and they are licensed <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?>CC-BY-SA</a>.
