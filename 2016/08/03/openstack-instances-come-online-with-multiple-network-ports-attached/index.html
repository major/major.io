On various occasions, instances were coming online with multiple network ports attached, even though I only asked for one network port.</p><h2 id=the-problem>The problem</h2><p>If I issued a build request for ten instances, I&rsquo;d usually end up with this:</p><ul><li>6 instances with one network port attached</li><li>2-3 instances with two network ports attached <em>(not what I want)</em></li><li>1-2 instances with three or four network ports attached <em>(<strong>definitely</strong> not what I want)</em></li></ul><p>When I examined the instances with multiple network ports attached, I found that one of the network ports would be marked as <em>up</em> while the others would be marked as <em>down</em>. However, the IP addresses associated with those extra ports would still be associated with the instance in horizon and via the nova API. All of the network ports seemed to be fully configured on the neutron side.</p><h2 id=digging-into-neutron>Digging into neutron</h2><p>The neutron API logs are fairly chatty, especially while instances are building, but I found two interesting log lines for one of my instances:</p><pre><code>172.29.236.41,172.29.236.21 - - [02/Aug/2016 14:03:11] &quot;GET /v2.0/ports.json?tenant_id=a7b0519330ed481884431102a72dd04c&amp;device_id=05eef1bb-5356-43d9-86c9-4d9854d4d46b HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 2137 0.025282
172.29.236.11,172.29.236.21 - - [02/Aug/2016 14:03:15] &quot;GET /v2.0/ports.json?tenant_id=a7b0519330ed481884431102a72dd04c&amp;device_id=05eef1bb-5356-43d9-86c9-4d9854d4d46b HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 3098 0.027803
</code></pre><p>There are two requests to create network ports for this instance and neutron is allocating ports to both requests. This would normally be just fine, but I only asked for one network port on this instance.</p><p>The IP addresses making the requests are unusual, though. <code>172.29.236.11</code> and <code>172.29.236.41</code> are two of the hypervisors within my cloud. Why are both of them asking neutron for network ports? Only one of those hypervisors should be building my instance, not both. After checking both hypervisors, I verified that the instance was only provisioned on one of the hosts and not both.</p><h2 id=looking-at-nova-compute>Looking at nova-compute</h2><p>The instance ended up on the <code>172.29.236.11</code> hypervisor once it finished building and the logs on that hypervisor looked fine:</p><pre><code>nova.virt.libvirt.driver [-] [instance: 05eef1bb-5356-43d9-86c9-4d9854d4d46b] Instance spawned successfully.
</code></pre><p>I logged into the <code>172.29.236.41</code> hypervisor since it was the one that asked neutron for a port but it never built the instance. The logs there had a much different story:</p><pre><code>[instance: 05eef1bb-5356-43d9-86c9-4d9854d4d46b] Instance failed to spawn

</code></pre><p>If glance knows about the image, why can&rsquo;t that hypervisor build an instance with that image? While I was scratching my head, <a href=https://twitter.com/cloudnull>Kevin Carter</a> walked by my desk and joined in the debugging.</p><p>He asked about how I had deployed glance and what storage backend I was using. I was using the regular file storage backend since I don&rsquo;t have swift deployed in the environment. He asked me how many glance nodes I had (I had two) and if I was doing anything to sync the images between the glance nodes.</p><p>Then it hit me.</p><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/08/stitch_frustrated.gif></a></p><p>Although both glance nodes knew about the image (since that data is in the database), <strong>only one of the glance nodes had the actual image content (the actual qcow2 file) stored</strong>. That means that if a hypervisor requests the image from a glance node that knows about the image but doesn&rsquo;t have it stored, the hypervisor won&rsquo;t be able to retrieve the image.</p><p>Unfortunately, the checks go in this order on the nova-compute side:</p><ol><li>Ask glance if this image exists and if this tenant can use it</li><li>Configure the network</li><li>Retrieve the image</li></ol><p>If a hypervisor rolls through steps one and two without issues, but then fails on step 3, the network port will be provisioned but won&rsquo;t come up on the instance. There&rsquo;s nothing that cleans up that port in the Mitaka release, so it requires manual intervention.</p><h2 id=the-fix>The fix</h2><p>As a temporary workaround, I took one of the glance nodes offline so that only one glance node is being used. After hundreds of builds, all of the instances came up with only one network port attached!</p><p>There are a few options for long-term fixes.</p><p>I could deploy swift and put glance images into swift. That would allow me to use multiple glance nodes with the same swift backend. Another option would be to use an existing swift deployment, such as Rackspace&rsquo;s Cloud Files product.</p><p>Since I&rsquo;m not eager to deploy swift in my environment for now, I decided to remove the second glance node and reconfigure nova to use only one glance node. That means I&rsquo;m running with only one glance node and a failure there could be highly annoying. However, that trade-off is fine with me until I can get around to deploying swift.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I&rsquo;ve opened <a href=https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1609526>a bug</a> for nova so that the network ports are cleaned up if the instance fails to build.</p><p><em>Photo credit: <a href=https://flic.kr/p/tfpXk>Flickr: pascalcharest</a></em></p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/kvm/>#kvm</a>
