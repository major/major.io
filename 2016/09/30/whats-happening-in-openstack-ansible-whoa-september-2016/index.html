The race is on to finish up the Newton release and start new developments for the Ocata release! We hope to see lots of contributors in Barcelona!</p><p><img src=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-Arc_de_Triomf_Barcelona.jpg alt=6></p><h2 id=new-releases>New releases</h2><p>The OpenStack-Ansible releases are announced on the OpenStack development mailing list. Here are the things you need to know:</p><h3 id=newton>Newton</h3><p>The OpenStack-Ansible Newton release is still being finalized this week. The <code>stable/newton</code> branches were <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/379590/>created yesterday</a> and stabilization work is ongoing.</p><h3 id=mitaka>Mitaka</h3><p>Mitaka is the latest stable release available and the latest version is 13.3.4. This release includes some upgrade improvements for <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/366169/>ml2 ports</a> and <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/360539/>container hostname adjustments</a>.</p><ul><li><a href=https://review.openstack.org/379499>Version 13.3.4</a></li><li><a href=http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/openstack-ansible/mitaka.html>Release notes</a></li><li><a href=https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3880b24f381d7d4d31be036ef820c21e>Detailed changelog</a> <em>(from 13.3.1 to 13.3.4)</em></li></ul><h3 id=liberty>Liberty</h3><p>The latest Liberty release, 12.2.4, contains lots of updates and fixes. The updates include a <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/360385/>fix for picking up where you left off on a failed upgrade</a> and a <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/368066/>fix for duplicated log lines</a>. The security role received <a href=https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9fe1f5110e2d8f7c1d148d4b6968b5a9#openstack-ansible-security>some updates</a> to improve performance and reduce unnecessary logging.</p><ul><li><a href=https://review.openstack.org/379505/>Version 12.2.4</a></li><li><a href=http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/openstack-ansible/liberty.html>Release notes</a></li><li><a href=https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9fe1f5110e2d8f7c1d148d4b6968b5a9>Detailed changelog</a> <em>(from 12.2.1 to 12.2.4)</em></li></ul><h2 id=notable-discussions>Notable discussions</h2><p>This section covers discussions from the OpenStack-Ansible weekly meetings, IRC channels, mailing lists, or in-person events.</p><h3 id=newton-branch>Newton branch</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the <code>stable/newton</code> branches have arrived for OpenStack-Ansible! This will allow us to finish stabilizing the Newton release and look ahead to Ocata.</p><h3 id=octavia>Octavia</h3><p>Michael Johnson and Jorge Miramontes stopped by our weekly meeting to talk about how Octavia could be implemented in OpenStack-Ansible. Recent Octavia releases have some new features that should be valuable to OpenStack-Ansible deployers.</p><p>There is a <a href=http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-specs/specs/mitaka/lbaasv2.html>spec from the Liberty release</a> for deploying Octavia, but we were only able to get LBaaSv2 with the agent deployed. Jorge and Michael are working on a new spec to get Octavia deployed with OpenStack-Ansible.</p><h3 id=testing-repo>Testing repo</h3><p>There&rsquo;s now a <a href=https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-tests>centralized testing repository</a> for all OpenStack-Ansible roles. This allows the developers to share variables, scripts, and test cases between multiple roles. Developers can begin testing new roles with much less effort since the scaffolding for a basic test environment is available in the repository.</p><p>You can follow along with the development by watching the <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/q/topic:central-test-config>central-test-config</a> topic in Gerrit.</p><h3 id=mailing-list>Mailing list</h3><p>The OpenStack-Ansible tag was fairly quiet on the OpenStack Development mailing list during the time frame of this report, but there were a few threads:</p><ul><li><a href=http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-September/103671.html>cinder volume lxc and iscsi</a></li><li><a href=http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-September/104813.html>Blueprint discussion</a> <em>(for the Ocata OpenStack Summit)</em></li><li><a href=http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-September/104807.html>Newton RC2 available</a></li></ul><h2 id=notable-developments>Notable developments</h2><p>This section covers some of the improvements coming to Newton, the upcoming OpenStack release.</p><h3 id=openstack-ansible-training>OpenStack-Ansible Training</h3><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hastexo-logo-e1475245310720.png></a><a href=https://www.hastexo.com/>Hastexo</a> is now offering a <a href=https://www.hastexo.com/resources/news-releases/hx201-ansible>self-paced course</a> for learning OpenStack-Ansible! It&rsquo;s called HX201 Cloud Fundamentals for OpenStack-Ansible and it is available now.</p><p>Thanks to Florian Haas and Adolfo Brandes for assembling this course!</p><h3 id=openstack-ansible-powers-the-osic-cloud>OpenStack-Ansible powers the OSIC cloud</h3><p><a href=../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OSIC-Logo.png></a>One of the clouds operated by the <a href=https://osic.org/>OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC)</a> is powered by OpenStack-Ansible. It&rsquo;s a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environment and it provides the most nodes for the OpenStack CI service! If you need to test an application on a large OpenStack cloud, <a href=https://osic.org/clusters>apply for access</a> to the OSIC cluster.</p><h3 id=inventory-improvements>Inventory improvements</h3><p>The backbone of OpenStack-Ansible is its inventory. The dynamic inventory defines where each service should be deployed, configured and managed. Some recent improvements include <a href=https://review.openstack.org/#/c/371798/>exporting inventory</a> for use by other scripts or applications. Ocata should bring even more improvements to the dynamic inventory.</p><p>Thanks to Nolan Brubaker for leading this effort!</p><h3 id=install-guide>Install guide</h3><p>The installation guide has been completely overhauled! It has a more concise, opinionated approach to deployments and this should make the first deployment a little easier for newcomers. OpenStack can be a complex system to deploy and our goal is to provide the cleanest path to a successful deployment.</p><p>Thanks to Alex Settle for leading this effort!</p><h2 id=feedback>Feedback?</h2><p>The goal of this newsletter is three fold:</p><ul><li><p>Keep OpenStack-Ansible developers updated with new changes</p></li><li><p>Inform operators about new features, fixes, and long-term goals</p></li><li><p>Bring more people into the OpenStack-Ansible community to share their use</p><p>cases, bugs, and code</p></li></ul><p>Please let me know if you spot any errors, areas for improvement, or items that I missed altogether. I&rsquo;m <code>mhayden</code> on Freenode IRC and you can find me on <a href=https://twitter.com/majorhayden>Twitter</a> anytime.</p><p><em>Photo credit: Mattia Felice Palermo (Own work) <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/es/deed.en>CC BY-SA 3.0 es</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/ansible/>#ansible</a>
