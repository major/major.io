<content><p>When Twitter was still in its early stages, you could track certain search terms in near-realtime <a href=http://blog.twitter.com/2006/10/use-twitter-by-instant-message.html>via Jabber</a>. It was quite popular and its performance degraded over time as more users signed up and began posting updates. Eventually, Twitter killed the jabber bot altogether. <a href=http://www.lagesse.org/twitter-and-track/>Many users have asked when it will return</a>.</p><p>Well, it hasn&rsquo;t returned, but you can build your own replacement with ruby, a jabber account, and a few gems. While it won&rsquo;t do everything that the original jabber bot did, you can still track tweets mentioning certain terms very quickly.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how to get started:</p><p>First, install the <em>tweetstream</em> and <em>xmpp4r-simple</em> gems:</p><p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need a jabber account. You&rsquo;ll probably want to make one for the exclusive use of your jabber bot. I chose to make up a quick account at <a href=http://www.chatmask.com/>ChatMask</a> for mine.</p><p>The last step is to drop a copy of this script on your server:</p><p>You&rsquo;ll want to be sure to fill in the following:</p><ul><li>your jabber bot&rsquo;s username and password</li><li>the username and password for the twitter account that will monitor the stream</li><li>the search terms you want to track</li><li>the destination jabber account where the messages should be sent</li></ul><p>Ensure that your jabber account has authorized the jabber bot&rsquo;s account so that you&rsquo;ll actually receive the messages. Also, Twitter is <a href=http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation#FilterLimiting>very strict with their streaming API tracking terms</a>. It&rsquo;s a good idea to review their <a href=http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation>entire Streaming API documentation</a> to ensure that you&rsquo;re not going to end up having your account temporarily or permanently blacklisted.</p><p>Once everything is ready to go, you can just run the script within GNU screen or via nohup. There&rsquo;s still a bit more error checking to do around jabber reconnections, but the script has run non-stop for well over two weeks at a time without a failure.</p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/command-line/>#command line</a>
