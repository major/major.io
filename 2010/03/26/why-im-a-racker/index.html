<content><p><a href=http://rackblogs.com/talent/rackers/why-im-a-racker/></a>I normally try to keep my work-related items separate from this blog, but I felt that I needed to break tradition for a moment. Â The new <a href=http://www.rackertalent.com/ title="Rackspace Talent site">Rackspace Talent</a> site was released a few weeks ago and <a href=http://twitter.com/theredrecruiter title="Twitter: theredrecruiter">Michael Long</a> asked me to write a blog post about what it means to be a Racker (that&rsquo;s the term we use for employees of Rackspace).</p><p>After the post went up, I received as much feedback from people outside of Rackspace as I received from Rackers. Â The negative feedback I received was centered around the assertion that the post&rsquo;s content was &ldquo;fluffed&rdquo; to make the Rackspace experience seem better than it actually is. Â That couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</p><p>If you want to make comments on the post, or if you want to know more about working at Rackspace, let me know. Â Although I&rsquo;m not in sales and I&rsquo;m not in recruiting, I always enjoy talking to people about using Rackspace&rsquo;s services or working for Rackspace.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the post:Â <a href=http://www.rackertalent.com/rackers/why-im-a-racker/ title="Why I'm A Racker - Major Hayden">Rackspace Talent - Why I&rsquo;m a Racker</a></p></content><p><a href=https://major.io/tags/blog/>#blog</a>
